# Notes on running Sunless Citadel

Adventure link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/tftyp/a1/the-sunless-citadel

## Time line

The citadel itself is extremely old, and there is no dragon cult (or there was one from loooong ago, before the Great Golden Dragon took over).  The goblins and kobolds each moved in in the last 10 years.

## Changes to make

- Need to decide the role of goblins and kobolds in the Aurelian Empire
- If using the Rescue Mission hook, Sharwyn Hucrele needs to be a sorcerer or druid
- Oakhurst changes
  - Everyone is human, with a few goliaths and one or two elves
  - No weapons of war!
    - They will look the other way if the party has some
    - They can provide some if the party does not
