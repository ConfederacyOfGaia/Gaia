## Arcane-Infused Gemstones

The magic of the Great Dragons has a tendency to coalesce into gemstones.  The characters will find a few uncut gemstones that inexplicably glow with an internal radiance.  Using *detect magic* on one will identify enchantment magic on them, *identify* will describe its effect, and attuning to it will activate their power.  [Refer to the rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement) for how to attune to an item.

When rolling to determine what kind of gemstone is found, use the following dice based on the character tier:

| Tier | Character Level | Dice to use
| :-:  | :---: | :---:
| 1    | 1-4   | 2d4
| 2    | 5-10  | 2d6
| 3    | 11-16 | 2d8
| 4    | 17-20 | 2d10
