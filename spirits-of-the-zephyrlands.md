You have struck a bargain with the spirits of Gaia.  These spirits reside in all things: Plants, rocks, animals, the winds, even the land itself.  You draw power from these spirits and from their essence, infused into the very air you breathe.

At 1st level, when you choose this patron, you must decide on the type of spirits you have allied yourself with:

- [The Air](#the-air)
- [Death](#death)
- [The Earth](#the-earth)
- [Fire](#fire)
- [The Forest](#the-forest)
- [The Sea](#the-sea)

Your choice determines your spell list and the class features you gain at 1st, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.


<!--

### Something

#### Bonus Cantrip

At 1st level, you learn the *XXX* cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you and does not count against your number of cantrips known.

#### Eldritch Something

When you cast the *eldritch blast* cantrip, you can choose either force or XXX damage.  All other aspects of the spell remain the same.

#### Spirits' Aid

When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing a flurry of butterflies to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Spirits' Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Death Ward

Your pact with the spirits grants you a measure of protection from death.  The first time you would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.  If you are subjected to an effect that would kill you instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated.  Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
