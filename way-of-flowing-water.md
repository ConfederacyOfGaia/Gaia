### Way of Flowing Water

You have learned a style of combat that emulates flowing water:  Quick movements, combined with the ability to redirect your opponent's energy and momentum, allow you to use their own attacks against them and stay out of harm's way.

#### Flowing Water

At 3rd level, you learn to reposition yourself as part of your attacks.  When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use either the Patient Defense feature or Step of the Wind feature during the same turn without expending ki points, regardless of whether you hit or not.

#### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you

#### Momentum Control

At 11th level, your mastery of momentum allows you to affect others.  Whenever you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 or more ki points to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failure, the creature suffers the effects of the *slow* spell for a number of rounds equal to the number of ki points you spend.

#### 17th level

You gain the effects of *freedom of movement* at all times.  This cannot bedispelled.
