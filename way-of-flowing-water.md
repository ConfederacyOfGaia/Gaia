### Way of Flowing Water

You have learned a style of combat that emulates flowing water:  Quick movements, combined with the ability to redirect your opponent's energy and momentum, allow you to use their own attacks against them and stay out of harm's way.

#### Flowing Water

At 3rd level, you learn to reposition yourself as part of your attacks.  When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use either Patient Defense or Step of the Wind without expending ki points, regardless of whether you hit or not.

Also at 3rd level, your ability to go with the flow makes enemies more likely to overlook you.  You can to cast the *sanctuary* spell, with a range of self, for a cost of 2 ki points.  The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

#### Redirect Momentum

At 6th level, you learn to redirect an attacking creature's momentum, and use it to your advantage, regardless of whether the attack hits or misses.

When a creature targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to absorb the momentum of the blow.  If the attack hits, you can reduce the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.  If you reduce the damage to 0, or if the attack misses, as part of the same reaction you can take advantege of your positioning and the attack's momentum. You can expend 1 ki point and impose one of the following effects on that creature:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
- You can make a single unarmed strike against it, with advantage.
- You can attempt to Grapple it, with advantage.

#### Crashing Water Barrage

Upon reaching 11th level, you've fully embraced the ideals of your training and learn to overwhelm opponents like crashing water. Whenever you hit a single target with three or more attacks in one round, you can spend 1  or more ki points to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failure, the creature suffers the effects of the *slow* spell for a number of rounds equal to the number of ki points you spend.
