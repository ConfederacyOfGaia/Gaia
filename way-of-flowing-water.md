### Way of Flowing Water

You have learned a style of combat that emulates flowing water:  Quick movements, combined with the ability to redirect your opponent's energy and momentum, allow you to use their own attacks against them and stay out of harm's way.

#### Flowing Water

Your movements are always perfectly matched with your surroundings, allowing you to move in fluid perfection, remaining ever elusive.

Starting at 3rd level, you learn to redirect an attacking creature's momentum and use it to your advantage.  When a creature you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to absorb and redirect the momentum of that attack.  If the attack hits, you can reduce the damage you take from it by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.  If you reduce the damage to 0, or if the attack misses, as part of the same reaction you can expend 1 ki point and impose one of the following effects on that creature:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
- It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.
- You can make a single unarmed strike against it.


#### Momentum Control

At 6th level, you learn a new way to interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body.  When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to manipulate the target's momentum. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects of the *slow* spell until the end of your next turn (no concentration requried).

#### Freedom of Movement

Starting at 11th level, you gain the effects of *freedom of movement* at all times.  This cannot be dispelled.
