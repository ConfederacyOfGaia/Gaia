### Way of Flowing Water

You have learned a style of combat that emulates flowing water:  Quick movements, combined with the ability to redirect your opponent's energy and momentum, allow you to use their own attacks against them and stay out of harm's way.

#### Flowing Water

Your movements are always perfectly matched with your surroundings, allowing you to move in fluid perfection, remaining ever elusive.

Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in either the Athletics or Acrobatics skill. Furthermore, you may add your Wisdom modifier to any Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make to either resist or initiate a grapple or shove.

Also at 3rd level, you learn to reposition yourself as part of your attacks.  When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use either the Patient Defense feature or Step of the Wind feature during the same turn without expending ki points.

#### Redirect Momentum

At 6th level, you learn to redirect an attacking creature's momentum and use it to your advantage.  When a creature you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to absorb and redirect the momentum of that attack.  If the attack hits, you can reduce the damage you take from it by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.  If you reduce the damage to 0, or if the attack misses, as part of the same reaction you can expend 1 ki point and impose one of the following effects on that creature:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
- You can make a single unarmed strike against it.
- You can attempt to grapple it.

#### Momentum Control

At 11th level, your mastery of momentum allows you to affect others.  Whenever you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 or more ki points to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failure, the creature suffers the effects of the *slow* spell for a number of rounds equal to the number of ki points you spend.  You can spend a number of ki points equal to your Wisdom bonus per unarmed strike.

#### 17th level

You gain the effects of *freedom of movement* at all times.  This cannot be dispelled.
