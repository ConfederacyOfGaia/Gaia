# Mage

A Mage is a wielder of arcane magic, shaping the world to their whims.  Unlike druids, who strive to live in harmony with nature, mages seek to impose their will on reality.

Users of arcane magic are rare.  They will almost always be self-taught, and will be working from lost scraps of spellbooks they find in attics or dusty libraries.
