# Mage

A Mage is a wielder of arcane magic, shaping the world to their whims.  Unlike druids, who strive to live in harmony with nature, mages seek to impose their will on reality.

Users of arcane magic are rare.  They will almost always be self-taught, and will be working from lost scraps of spellbooks they find in attics or dusty libraries.  See [this class definition](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/H1wK2R3kZ) for all the details.  Mages must choose a school of magic to specialize it.

## Magic Sense

Starting at 2nd level, you can tell by looking at something if it's enchanted with arcane (but not natural) magic.  At 5th level, this ability improves so that you can also identify items enchanted with natural magic.
