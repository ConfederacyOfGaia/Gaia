# Mage

The ogre and the gnome squint at each other, sizing each other up, waiting for the other to move first.  Suddenly, the ogre lifts his tree branch to take a swing at the gnome, but before its blow can land, the gnome dives to the side and sends several fireballs streaking into the ogre, dousing it in flames.

With a final glance at his notes, a young man clad in plain blue robes begins the last step of the ritual. The chalk circle, sprinkled with powdered silver and iron, begins to glow as he channels magic through it to a focused point that would become the fulcrum of his spell.

Peering out from beneath her broad-brimmed hat, an elf lifts her hands towards the oncoming bandits. A dozen missiles of pure force leap from her hands and, in seconds, the bandits lay in a heap before her, never knowing what hit them.

Fingers tracing the runes etched into the wall of the ruined tower, a man in rough leathers reaches out with his mind to count and mark its inhabitants.

With a swipe of her hand, the aged woman lifts the downed tree trunk from the other side of the riverbank and uses it to batter the young dragon out of the sky and into mountain side.

Mages carry an arcane birthright that fuels their magical powers. It is a rare gift, and few have the strength to embrace it, let alone the will to master it. A mage can use their innate gift to wield the power of the elements, teleport vast distances, and heal -- or kill -- in an instant.

### Arcane Birthright

In this day and age, one does not simply become a mage.  The affinity for the arcane bubbles up in your soul slowly, driving your quest for knowledge until you manage to find a book or scroll that promises to teach you some of the secrets of magic.  While the years of searching for and studying every scrap of information differentiate mages from the average person with arcane potential, the gift of magic is an eldritch inheritance that one cannot learn. The gift is transmitted by means that are not fully understood, and most often it manifests around the time of adolescence, though sometimes it can lie dormant for years.

Not everyone who possesses this magical gift has it in equal measure. For many, the gift may go largely unnoticed throughout their lives, aside from an occasional prophetic dream or accidental fire. Those with a strong connection and amibiton to match, however, can use their powers to achieve extraordinary effects, and may even be considered worthy of tutelage by an experienced mage.

Mages record their arcane secrets in spellbooks and guard them from their enemies. Such resources are not the basis of a mage's power, however. Losing a spellbook represents a setback to advancing the mage's arcane knowledge, not a threat to their entire craft, and finding another mage's spellbook could advance a mage's knowledge by many years.

### Masters of the Arcane

A mage, though possessed of an auspicious birthright, is not born, they are made. Becoming a mage involves tremendous dedication to mastering the advanced theory and intricate subtleties of the arcane. Such commitment can border on obsession, and a mage often measures their life in spells mastered and secrets gleaned. With lifespans greatly extended by the eldritch caress of the arcane, a mage may spend centuries practicing their craft and even create new spells that carry on their name. 

Because of their dedication to their craft, few mages can be found engaged in a livelihood that does not involve their powers. Mages who run shops sell enchanted items and potions, or simply offer their spellcasting services for a fee.  Before the Great Devastation, mages could be found lecturing at academies or advising wealthy nobles on matters of the arcane, but those days passed with the flames that consumed the arcane institutions.  Due to the broad applications of magic and the extended lifespan of a mage, many are also experts in various fields such as natural science and statecraft, making them wellsprings of knowledge to anyone with the coin to secure their services.

### Creating a mage

When creating a mage, think about how you came into your power. Were your parents or grandparents mages, and there was little surprise that the gift passed to you? Or were you already apprenticed to a local tradesman when the awakening of your powers changed the trajectory of your life forever? Do you have an uncommonly strong gift, or are you sufficiently talented as to keep up with your peers through superior technique? 

How do you feel about your gift? Do you revel in the power, or do you fear that it is actually a curse? Do you believe it was granted to you for a reason, or is it merely a result of the vagaries of fate? 

What drew you from the safety and comfort of your library or laboratory? Are you seeking mysteries gleaned from your research? Are you trying to complete the work of your late mentor? 

```
```

\page

### Spellcasting

Magic is your birthright and it suffuses your entire being. Your spells are fuelled by an innate font of power which you learn to wield through study and practice. 

Unlike other spellcasters who obtain their power through external means, your magic is inherent and does not rely on verbal, somatic, or material components, except where such components are the focus of the spell (such as a wooden chest for  *Leomund's secret chest* or the powdered silver and iron that is used to draw a *magic circle*). If a spell requires a  focus, such as *scrying*, you still require the focus to cast the spell.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the mage table. 

#### Spells Known

At 1st level, you know several 1st level spells of your choice:  3 + your intelligence bonus.  Every time you gain a level, you have the ability learn a number of new spells per level equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), which can be of any level that you can cast.

#### Casting Spells

Every time you gain a level, you roll for new spell points, much like you roll for new hit points: You get 1d4+4 spell points per level + your Intelligence modifier.  To cast one of your known spells, you must expend a number of spell points determined by the level of the spell you are casting (see the Spell Point Cost table, below). If you reduce your spell point total to 0, you gain a level of exhaustion. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to to cast a maximum of one spell of each level above 5th until you take a long rest. If you attempt to cast another spell of the same level before taking a long rest, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + the level at which you are casting the spell). If you fail the saving throw, you take 1d6 points of necrotic damage for each level of the spell. If you succeed the saving throw, you take half damage. If you survive the damage, the spell is successful.

If you cast a spell with insufficient spell points to pay for its cost, you subtract your total remaining spell points from the spell's cost and suffer 1d6 necrotic damage for every unpaid spell point remaining. For example, if you have four spell points and attempt to cast a 3rd level spell, which costs five spell points, you would take 1d6 necrotic damage. If you survive this damage, the spell succeeds. 

If your Intelligence score increases or decreases over the course of your career and your modifier changes, your spell point total increases or decreases in accordnce with the modifier change.


##### Spell Point Cost

| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |
| 6th | 9 |
| 7th | 10 |
| 8th | 11 |
| 9th | 13 |


#### Learning Spells

When you gain the ability to learn new spells, you do not automatically gain these new spells; you must research them, either by consulting with another mage that already knows the spell, by copying them from another mage's spellbook or scroll, or by doing original research.  If you are working with another mage, their level and specialization do not matter, as long as they can communicate the spell to you.  If you do not have immediate access to new spells when you gain a level, you can hold on to your new spell slots for whenever you get the opportunity to learn a spell.  At 3rd level, you gain the Magical Research class feature, which enables you to research and learn a spell without another mage or spellbook to copy from.

The process of learning a new spell of 1st level or higher takes 1d4 days of research, practice, and study per spell level, minus your Intelligence bonus (minimum of 1 day).  At the end of this period of study, you need to make an Intelligence check to see if you learn it; if you fail the check, you can try again the following day (although there is no other penalty).  The DC for a spell is 5 plus the spell's level, plus your Intelligence bonus.  If the spell is on the general mage spell list or your specialization's spell list, you can also add your proficiency bonus to the check.  If you are working with another mage, you can add their proficiency bonus to the check as well, as they can guide you through the process of learning the spell and help correct mistakes.  If your total bonus to learn a spell is greater than the DC of the check, you still need to spend the time, but you can assume the check passed.

The process for learning a new cantrip is much simpler, and does not require practice or study: Cantrips are simple enough that a mage can learn them spontaneously and without training.

Any time you gain or lose points on your Intelligence score, you gain or lose the appropriate number of spells that you know, starting with those most recently learned.  For this reason, mages often record the spells they know in a spellbook, so that they can relearn them later in case the unthinkable happens. 

\page

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

> ##### Spellbooks?
> Unlike other campaign settings, where a spellcaster is beholden to their book of spells, in Gaia, there is no such limitation.  When a mage learns a spell, it is committed to their long-term memory, and becomes part of their being.  They have no need to prepare their spells at the beginning of the adventuring day, and they cannot exchange the spells they know for other spells when they gain levells.
>
> Even though mages do not require a spellbook to store their spells, many keep one anyway:  There are several ways that mages can forget spells that they know, including losing points from their Intelligence score or certain types of magical damage.  If spells are recorded, then they can be relearned when the mage restores their Intelligence score to its former glory or gains another level.
>
> Because mgaes are so rare, and finding spells can be difficult, finding another mage's spellbook is possibly the best treasure a mage can find.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for mage spells, as you manipulate natural laws in a carefully-planned manner. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___
- **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier


#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.  Casting a spell of 6th level or higher as a ritual removes the requirement that you make Constitution check, and multiple can be cast in a single day.

### Arcane Recovery

You are able to draw from the latent magic in the environment to replenish your power reserves. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain expended spell points equal to the cost of a spell of the highest level you can cast, to a maximum of 9 spell points. 

For example, if you're a 4th-level mage, you can recover up to 3 expended spell points (the cost of a 2nd-level spell) . 

### Arcane Sense

The presence of magic resonates deeply with you.  Unless a spell effect is concealed (such as with *Nystul's magic aura*), you are automatically aware of the presence of magic or magical effects within 30 feet of you.

Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can open your perception to investigate such forces more intently. You may cast *detect magic* without expending any spell points and requiring no verbal, somatic, or material components.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Arcane Specialization

When you reach 2nd level, you choose a specialization:  Elementalist, Guardian, Illusionist, Psychokineticist, Sage, or Traveler, all detailed at the end of the class description.  Your specialization is very important, as it defines your approach and access to magic for the rest of your career.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Magical Research

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to recreate spells from your specializations spell list.  This means you can learn spells on your own without needing an external resource.  You can recreate a spell of a any level that you can cast.  The time to research a spell is the same as the time to learn it from another mage (see the Learning New Spells section).  Depending on the spell, this research might require access to a library and materials equal to 3d10 gilders per spell level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternately, you can choose to forgo the ability score increase and take a Feat instead.

### Spell Mastery

Starting at 11th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you are able to cast them with little effort.  Choose a 1st-level spell that is in your spellbook:  You can cast it at half the standard spell point cost.  At 15th level, you can choose a 2nd level spell, and at 18th, you can choose a 3rd level spell.

If you cast a mastered spell at a higher level, you must complete a short or long rest to be able to do so again at half the standard spell point cost.  By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange the spells you chose for different spells of the same level.

## Core Mage Spell List

This core list should be slim, and only contain a few broadly applicable spells.  Most of the intereesting stuff and lavor comes from subclasses.  Spells marked with \* I'm unsure of.  Might need to expand the list a little, but there shouldn't be more than a few generic spells per level, and for 7-9 there should be only 1.

Spell Level | Spells
:--- | :---
Cantrips | Mending, Light, Resistance
1st | Comprehend Languages, Detect Magic, Find Familiar, Identify, Illusory Script\*
2nd | Arcane Lock, Enhance Ability, Knock, Find Object, Magic Weapon
3rd | Dispel Magic, Glyph of Warding, Magic Circle, Nondetection
4th | Arcane Eye, Fabricate, Locate Creature
5th | Geas\*, Legend Lore
6th | Contingency, Instant Summons
7th | Symbol
8th |
9th | 

* Need a simpler version of Instanct Summons, similar to HP's *accio*, that requires attunement with the object and then a single command to summon it.  Probably 3rd level.
* Scour the other sources for more spells.

<!-- Here begin the subclasses -->

\page

## Arcane Specializations

A mage's choice of arcane tradition reveals more about their nature than their strategy. Individual mages are drawn to a school of magic to which they have an affinity. Often enough a mage can supply a practical reason for their preference, for each school has unique strengths over others, but the simple truth is that a mage's personality and the character of their specialization are usually in alignment because a mage's personal and mystical nature are deeply intertwined. 

### Elementalist

You are drawn to a particular element -- Air, Earth, Fire, or Water -- and invigorated by it.  When you choose this specialization at 2nd level, you must pick one of the four elements in which to specialize.  

#### Elemental Attunement

Once you pick your specilization element, you gain resistance to damage from that element, and advantage on all saving throws related to that element.  Additionally, the cost and time you must spend to copy spells of your element into your spellbook is halved.  Unfortunately, this comes at a price:  You can never learn spells of the opposed element, and you have disadvantage on saving throws related to your opposite element.

#### Elemental Spell Lists

You have full access to the spell lists of your primary element and the two adjacent  elements, but may never cast spells from your opposing element.  Not every spell level is represented for all elements.

Element | Adjecent Elements | Opposed Element
:--- | :--- |  :---
Air | Fire, Water | Earth
Earth | Fire, Water | Air
Fire | Air, Earth | Water
Water | Air, Earth | Fire

At 2nd level, you may choose a 1st level spell for your element to add to your spell book.

#### Elemental Shaping

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell from your elemental list, you may apply the benefits of **Distant Spell**, **Extended Spell**, or **Subtle Spell** to the spell. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest or when you use your Arcane Recovery wizard feature

Also at 6th level, you no longer have disadvantage on saving throws related to your opposed element.

Finally, at 6th level, you may choose an additional spell from your element's spell list and add it to your spellbook.  This spell can be of any level that you can cast.

#### Elemental Mastery

At 10th level, you become a master of your element. When casting a wizard spell of at least 1st level in your element, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and increase the save DC by +1.

Also, at 10th level, you may choose an additional spell from your element's spell list and add it to your spellbook.  This spell can be of any level that you can cast.

#### Elemental Form

At 14th level, you gain the ability to take on the form of an elemental.  Boom!

### Illusionist

You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists—including many gnome magi—are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

#### Illusions Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the cost of illusion spells is halved for you.  However, because of your focus on illusions, you have a harder time casting divination spells, and their cost is increased by 1.

In addition, the time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare illusion spells in half the normal time.

#### Improved Minor Illusion

When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the *minor illusion* cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different mage cantrip of yourchoice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast *minor illusion*, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

#### Malleable Illusions

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion) , provided that you can see the illusion.

#### Resistance to Illusions

Starting at 6th level, you become more adept at recognizing illusions, and so have advantage on all saving throws to detect or resist them.

#### Illusory Self

Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Illusory Reality

By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell at 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

### Sage

You are a scholar, fascinated by and drawn to knowledge, and magic of all varieties. Your research draws wider connections between all manifestations of the arcane, granting you unparalleled versatility and vision in your spellcasting endeavours. 

#### Lore Master

At 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. You gain proficiency in the Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills. If you are already proficiency in any of those skills, double your proficiency bonus for that skill instead.

In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).


#### Improved Spellcasting

Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a spell that cast at higher levels for an additional or improved effect, the spell is cast at one level higher than the level for which you paid spell points. This effect cannot increase a spell's level above 9th. 

#### Prodigious Memory

Starting at 10th level, you add the *legend lore* spell to your spellbook. If you already know this spell, you add a different wizard spell of 5th level or lower to your spellbook.

#### Improved Spell Mastery

At 15th and 18th levels, when you gain mastery of 2nd and 3rd level spells, you gain mastery over an additional 1st level spell.

#### Master of the Arcane

Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier to the number of spell points recovered when you use Arcane Recovery. 

Additionally, when you cast a spell that requires you to make an ability check as part of casting that spell (as in *counterspell* and *dispel magic*), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check. 

#### Spell Resistance

Due to your tarting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

### Traveler

Teleport, dimension door, misty step, planer travel, etc.  Might not be enough to build a subclass around.


#### Benign Transposition

Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell at 1st level or higher.

### Psychokineticist

The Psychokineticist is a master of *telekinesis*:  The ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects using arcane force.

#### Minor Telekinesis

Starting at 2nd level, you may use your psychokinetic powers to move small objects around you. You can focus on a number of objects equal to your spell attack modifier, as if concentrating on a spell. The objects must not be being worn or carried by an unwilling creature, or weigh more than 10 pounds, and can be moved independently in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.

The effect ends on an object you lose sight of, or that is further than 30 feet away from you. You can end the effect on any of the objects at any time.

#### Telekinetic Armor

Beginning at 6th level, your training with your telekinesis has hardened your mind against outside assault, granting you resistance to all psychic damage.

Additionally, when you see a creature within 60 feet of you make a weapon attack against you or another creature, you may use your reaction to add your spell attack modifier to the AC of the target of the attack, telekinetically attempting to deflect the attack.  Each use of this ability costs you 1 spell point.

#### Mental Manipulation

Starting at 10th level, you learn the *telekinesis* spell, in addition to any other spells you learn.  It does not count against your prepared spells, and you can cast it at a reduced cost: 8 - your proficiency bonus.

#### Psychokinetic Crush

Beginning at 14th level, your control over your psychokinetic abilities has reached its peak. As an action, you may target one creature within 60 feet of you, and attempt to telekinetically crush them. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 force damage, and falls prone. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and does not fall prone.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Guardian

A Guardian focuses their talents on a small number of offensive and defensive spells, and masters their use.  Starting at 2nd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels, you can choose one offensive and one defensive spell from the lists below to add to your spellbook, if you do not already have them.  The spell point cost for each spell is halved, and efficacy of many increases over time.  Some of the spells on these lists are 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level spells; you cannot take these until your maximum spell level allows it.  For example, you cannot take *stoneskin* before 10th level. 

Many of these spells has a slight modification when used by a Guardian that causes the damage done or protection granted to increase as the Guardian's proficiency bonus.  These modifications do not adjust the spell point cost.   If you learn one of these spells through the normal process, they are still considered a Guardian spell for you and are modified the same as if you had chosen them as a class feature.

Guardians tend to take Feats related to fighting, for example Martial Arts, Dagger Master, and Quarterstaff Master.
