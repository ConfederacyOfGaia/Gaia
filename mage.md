# Mage

With a final glance at his notes, a young man clad in the plain robes of an initiate begins the last step of the ritual. The chalk circle, sprinkled with powdered silver and iron, begins to glow as he channels magic through it to a focused point that would become the fulcrum of his spell. 

Peering out from beneath her broad-brimmed hat, a gnome lifts her hands towards the oncoming bandits. Bright flames spring to life along her slender hands and surge forward to greet her foes.

Fingers tracing the runes etched into a long-forgotten ruin, a man in rough leathers reaches out with his sixth sense to find the source of the temple's lingering power. 

Mages carry an arcane birthright that fuels their magical powers. It is a rare gift, and few have the strength to embrace it, let alone the will to master it. A mage can use their innate gift to wield the power of the elements, teleport vast distances, and heal----or kill----in an instant. 

### Arcane Birthright

One does not simply become a mage. While the years of training spent learning to control their powers differentiate mages from the average person with arcane potential, the gift of magic is an eldritch inheritance that one cannot learn. The gift is transmitted by means that are not fully understood, and most often it manifests around the time of adolescence, though sometimes it can lie dormant for years. 

Not everyone who possesses this magical gift has it in equal measure. For many, the gift may go largely unnoticed throughout their lives, aside from an occasional prophetic dream or accidental fire. Those with a strong connection, however, can use their powers to achieve extraordinary effects, and may even be considered worthy of tutelage by an experienced mage, or perhaps an academy. 

Mages record their arcane secrets in spellbooks and guard them from their enemies. Such resources are not the basis of a mage's power, however. Losing a spellbook represents a setback to advancing the mage's arcane knowledge, not a threat to their entire craft, and finding another mage's spellbook could advance a mage's knowledeg by many years.

### Masters of the Arcane

A mage, though possessed of an auspicious birthright, is not born, they are made. Becoming a mage involves tremendous dedication to mastering the advanced theory and intricate subtleties of the arcane. Such commitment can border on obsession, and a mage often measures their life in spells mastered and secrets gleaned. With lifespans greatly extended by the eldritch caress of the arcane, a mage may spend centuries practicing their craft and even create new spells that carry on their name. 

Because of their dedication to their craft, few mages can be found engaged in a livelihood that does not involve their powers. Mages who run shops sell enchanted items and potions, or simply offer their spellcasting services for a fee. Mages can also be found lecturing at academies or

```
```

advising wealthy nobles on matters of the arcane. Due to the broad applications of magic and the extended lifespan of a mage, many are also experts in various fields such as natural science and statecraft, making them wellsprings of knowledge to anyone with the coin to secure their services. 

### Creating a mage

When creating a mage, think about how you came into your power. Were your parents mages, and there was little surprise that the gift passed to you? Or were you already apprenticed to a local tradesman when the awakening of your powers changed the trajectory of your life forever? Do you have an uncommonly strong gift, or are you sufficiently talented as to keep up with your peers through superior technique? 

How do you feel about your gift? Do you revel in the power, or do you fear that it is actually a curse? Do you believe it was granted to you for a reason, or is it merely a result of the vagaries of fate? 

What drew you from the safety and comfort of your library or laboratory? Are you seeking mysteries gleaned from your research? Are you trying to complete the work of your late mentor?

```

### Spellcasting

Magic is your birthright and it suffuses your entire being. Your spells are fuelled by an innate font of power which you learn to wield through study and practice. 

Unlike other spellcasters who obtain their power through external means, your magic is inherent and does not rely on verbal, somatic, or material components, except where such components are the focus of the spell (such as a wooden chest for  *Leomund's secret chest* or the powdered silver and iron that is used to draw a *magic circle*) . If a spell requires a  focus, such as *scrying*, you still require the focus to cast the spell.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the mage table. 


\page


#### Spellbook

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level spells of your choice.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>



> ##### Your Spellbook
> A spellbook is a collection of arcane secrets and formulae that you have researched or acquired during the course of your career. The spellbook itself, along with its contents, are not magical; the words and images no more the essence of the spells than musical notations are the actual sounds produced by an instrument or voice. Many magi enchant their spellbooks to ward it against moisture or flame, but the book itself is simply a collection of ink, parchment, and binding, and is largely replacable.  
> 
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level equal to or lower than your maximum spell level and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the spell's mechanics, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
>
>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours. Once you have spent this time, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
>
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour for each level of the copied spell.
>
>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
>
> ***The Book’s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of arcane theory used to aid the preparation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

```
```

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The mage table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. At each level, add a number of points equal to your Inteligence bonus as well. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell points determined by the level of the spell you are casting (see the Spell Point Cost table, below) . If you reduce your spell point total to 0, you gain a level of exhaustion. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to to cast a maximum of one spell of each level above 5th until you take a long rest. If you attempt to cast another spell of the same level before taking a long rest, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + the level at which you are casting the spell) . If you fail the saving throw, you take 1d6 points of necrotic damage for each level of the spell. If you succeed the saving throw, you take half damage. If you survive the damage, the spell is successful.

If you cast a spell with insufficient spell points to pay for its cost, you subtract your total remaining spell points from the spell's cost and suffer 1d6 necrotic damage for every unpaid spell point remaining. For example, if you have four spell points and attempt to cast a 3rd level spell, which costs five spell points, you would take 1d6 necrotic damage. If you survive this damage, the spell succeeds. 

Mages can learn any number of spells, but can only keep a certain number of different spells in their minds at any given time. A mage can stay familiarized with a number of spells equal to their Intelligence modifier + their mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must not be of a level that exceeds your maximum spell level, as indicated on the mage table. You can change your list of prepared spells during a short rest, though doing so requires ten minutes per level of the spell you are adding to your list of prepared spells. You may replace any number of prepared spells after a long rest. 

For example, if you want to swap two spells for two other 3rd-level spells, you would have to spend an hour studying your spellbook (thirty minutes per 3rd-level spell) . 

A mage does not have to prepare their spells every day as clerics or druids do. They retain the same prepared spells until they choose to change them. If a mage loses their spellbook, they can create another by recording the spells they have prepared into a new book. If a mage's spellbook contained more spells than they had prepared, the mage would have to learn those spells again, though the gold and time required to do so is halved. 

##### Spell Point Cost

| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |
| 6th | 9 |
| 7th | 10 |
| 8th | 11 |
| 9th | 13 |

\page

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for mage spells, as you manipulate natural laws in a carefully-planned manner. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___
- **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have that spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. 

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells. See the "Arcane Focus" sidebar for more information. 

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a mage level, you can add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level either equal to or lower than the maximum spell level you can cast, as shown on the mage table. On your adventures, you may find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar) . 


<img 
  src='http://i.imgur.com/hsozlvi.png?1' 
  style='width:325px' />
<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

```
```

### Arcane Recovery

You are able to draw from the latent magic in the environment to replenish your power reserves. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain expended spell points equal to the cost of a spell of the highest level you can cast, to a maximum of 9 spell points. 

For example, if you're a 4th-level mage, you can recover up to 3 expended spell points (the cost of a 2nd-level spell) . 


### Arcane Sense

The presence of magic resonates deeply with you.  Unless a spell effect is concealed (such as with *Nystul's magic aura*), you are automatically aware of the presence of magic or magical effects within 30 feet of you.

Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can open your perception to investigate such forces more intently. You may cast *detect magic* without expending any spell points and requiring no verbal, somatic, or material components.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Arcane Specialization

When you reach 2nd level, you choose a specialization:  Elementalist, Illusionist, Psychokineticist, Sage, Traveler, or Warmage, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.


### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternately, you can choose to forgo the ability score increase and take a Feat instead.

### Spell Mastery

Starting at 11th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you are able to cast them with little effort.  Choose a 1st-level spell that is in your spellbook. You always have this spell prepared, it doesn't count against the total the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast it at half the standard spell point cost.  At 15th level, you can choose a 2nd level spell, and at 18th, you can choose a 3rd level spell.

If you cast a mastered spell at a higher level, you must complete a short or long rest to be able to do so again at half the standard spell point cost.  By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange the spells you chose for different spells of the same level.

\page

## Arcane Specialization

A mage's choice of arcane tradition reveals more about their nature than their strategy. Individual mages are drawn to a school of magic to which they have an affinity. Often enough a mage can supply a practical reason for their preference, for each school has unique strengths over others, but the simple truth is that a mage's personality and the character of their specialization are usually in alignment because a mage's personal and mystical nature are deeply intertwined. 


```
```

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


> ##### Arcane Focus

> An arcane focus is a special item—an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item—designed to channel the power of arcane spells. It is not necessary for a mage to possess an arcane focus in order to cast spells, but powerful focuses such as *wands of the war wizard* can enhance the potency of a mage's power. 
>
>An arcane focus can also function in place of a special focus for a spell if it roughly approximates the form of the focus called for by the spell. For example, a crystal focus could serve as the spell focus when casting the *clairvoyance* spell. 

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


\page

### Elementalist

You are drawn to a particular element -- Air, Earth, Fire, or Water -- and invigorated by it.  When you choose this specialization at 2nd level, you must pick one of the four elements in which to specialize.  

#### Elemental Attunement

Once you pick your specilization element, you gain resistance to damage from that element, and advantage on all saving throws related to that element.  Additionally, the cost and time you must spend to copy spells of your element into your spellbook is halved.  Unfortunately, this comes at a price:  You can never learn spells of the opposed element, and you have disadvantage on saving throws related to your opposite element.

#### Elemental Spell Lists

You have full access to the spell lists of your primary element and the two adjacent  elements, but may never cast spells from your opposing element.  Point costs for your primary element are halved.  Not every spell level is represented for all elements.

Element | Adjecent Elements | Opposed Element
:--- | :--- |  :---
Air | Fire, Water | Earth
Earth | Fire, Water | Air
Fire | Air, Earth | Water
Water | Air, Earth | Fire

At 2nd level, you may choose a 1st level spell for your element to add to your spell book.

#### Elemental Shaping

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell from your elemental list, you may apply the benefits of **Distant Spell**, **Extended Spell**, or **Subtle Spell** to the spell. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest or when you use your Arcane Recovery wizard feature

Also at 6th level, you no longer have disadvantage on saving throws related to your opposed element.

Finally, at 6th level, you may choose an additional spell from your element's spell list and add it to your spellbook.  This spell can be of any level that you can cast.

#### Elemental Mastery

At 10th level, you become a master of your element. When casting a wizard spell of at least 1st level in your element, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and increase the save DC by +1.

Also, at 10th level, you may choose an additional spell from your element's spell list and add it to your spellbook.  This spell can be of any level that you can cast.

#### Elemental Form

At 14th level, you gain the ability to take on the form of an elemental.  Boom!

```
```

### Illusionist

You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists—including many gnome magi—are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

#### Illusions Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the cost of illusion spells is halved for you.  However, because of your focus on illusions, you have a harder time casting divination spells, and their cost is increased by 1.

In addition, the time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare illusion spells in half the normal time.

#### Improved Minor Illusion

When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the *minor illusion* cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different mage cantrip of yourchoice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast *minor illusion*, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

#### Malleable Illusions

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion) , provided that you can see the illusion.

#### Resistance to Illusions

Starting at 6th level, you become more adept at recognizing illusions, and so have advantage on all saving throws to detect or resist them.

#### Illusory Self

Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Illusory Reality

By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell at 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

```

\page

### Sage

You are fascinated and drawn to magic of all varieties. Your research draws wider connections between all manifestations of the arcane, granting you unparalleled versatility and vision in your spellcasting endeavours. 

#### Spell Maven

Beginning when you choose this school at 2nd level, you may add your proficiency bonus when calculating the number of spells you can have prepared. 

You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, if you don't already have it.

#### Improved Spellcasting

Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a spell that cast at higher levels for an additional or improved effect, the spell is cast at one level higher than the level for which you paid spell points. This effect cannot increase a spell's level above 9th. 

#### Arcane Genius

At 10th level, you gain an ability granted by a different Arcane Tradition which normally becomes available at 6th level or lower. 

#### Improved Spell Mastery

At 15th and 18th levels, when you gain mastery of 2nd and 3rd level spells, you gain mastery over an additional 1st level spell.

#### Master of the Arcane

Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier to the number of spell points recovered when you use Arcane Recovery. 

Additionally, when you cast a spell that requires you to make an ability check as part of casting that spell (as in *counterspell* and *dispel magic*), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check. 

#### Spell Resistance

Due to your tarting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.


\page

### Traveler

Teleport, dimension door, misty step, planer travel, etc.  Might not be enough to build a subclass around.


#### Benign Transposition

Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell at 1st level or higher.

\page

### Psychokineticist

#### Minor Telekinesis

Starting at 2nd level, you may use your psychokinetic powers to move small objects around you. You can focus on a number of objects equal to your spell attack modifier, as if concentrating on a spell. The objects must not be being worn or carried by an unwilling creature, or weigh more than 10 pounds, and can be moved independently in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.

The effect ends on an object you lose sight of, or that is further than 30 feet away from you. You can end the effect on any of the objects at any time.

#### Telekinetic Ward

Beginning at 6th level, your training with your telekinesis has hardened your mind against outside assault, granting you resistance to all psychic damage.

Additionally, when you see a creature within 60 feet of you make a weapon attack against you or another creature, you may use your reaction to add your spell attack modifier to the AC of the target of the attack, telekinetically attempting to deflect the attack. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

#### Mental Manipulation

Starting at 10th level, you add the *telekinesis* spell to your mental archive, if it isn’t there already. You can cast telekinesis without expending a spell slot.
Once you cast telekinesis in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

#### Psychokinetic Crush

Beginning at 14th level, your control over your psychokinetic abilities has reached its peak. As an action, you may target one creature within 60 feet of you, and attempt to telekinetically crush them. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 force damage, and falls prone. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and does not fall prone.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Warmage

A Warmage focuses their talents on a small number of offensive and defensive spells, and masters their use.  Starting at 2nd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels, you can choose one offensive and one defensive spell from the lists below to add to your spellbook, if you do not already have them.  The spell point cost for each spell is halved, and efficacy of each one increases over time.  Some of the spells on these lists are 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level spells; you cannot take these until your maximum spell level allows it.  For example, you cannot take *stoneskin* before 10th level.

Many of these spells has a slight modification when used by a Warmage that causes the damage done or protection granted to increase as the Warmage's proficiency bonus.  These modifications do not adjust the spell point cost.

Warmages tend to take Feats related to fighting, for example Martial Arts, Dagger Master, and Quarterstaff Master.
