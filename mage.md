# Mage

The ogre and the gnome squint at each other, sizing each other up, waiting for the other to move first.  Suddenly, the ogre lifts his tree branch to take a swing at the gnome, but before its blow can land, the gnome dives to the side and sends several fireballs streaking into the ogre, dousing it in flames.

With a final glance at his notes, a young man clad in plain blue robes begins the last step of the ritual. The chalk circle, sprinkled with powdered silver and iron, begins to glow as he channels magic through it to a focused point that would become the fulcrum of his spell.

Peering out from beneath her broad-brimmed hat, an elf lifts her hands towards the oncoming bandits. A dozen missiles of pure force leap from her hands and, in seconds, the bandits lay in a heap before her, never knowing what hit them.

Fingers tracing the runes etched into the wall of the ruined tower, a man in rough leathers reaches out with his mind to count and mark its inhabitants.

With a swipe of her hand, the aged woman lifts the downed tree trunk from the other side of the riverbank and uses it to batter the young dragon out of the sky and into mountain side.

Mages carry an arcane birthright that fuels their magical powers. It is a rare gift, and few have the strength to embrace it, let alone the will to master it. A mage can use their innate gift to wield the power of the elements, teleport vast distances, and heal -- or kill -- in an instant.

### Arcane Birthright

In this day and age, one does not simply become a mage.  The affinity for the arcane bubbles up in your soul slowly, driving your quest for knowledge until you manage to find a book or scroll that promises to teach you some of the secrets of magic.  While the years of searching for and studying every scrap of information differentiate mages from the average person with arcane potential, the gift of magic is an eldritch inheritance that one cannot learn. The gift is transmitted by means that are not fully understood, and most often it manifests around the time of adolescence, though sometimes it can lie dormant for years.

Not everyone who possesses this magical gift has it in equal measure. For many, the gift may go largely unnoticed throughout their lives, aside from an occasional prophetic dream or accidental fire. Those with a strong connection and amibiton to match, however, can use their powers to achieve extraordinary effects, and may even be considered worthy of tutelage by an experienced mage.

Mages record their arcane secrets in spellbooks and guard them from their enemies. Such resources are not the basis of a mage's power, however. Losing a spellbook represents a setback to advancing the mage's arcane knowledge, not a threat to their entire craft, and finding another mage's spellbook could advance a mage's knowledge by many years.

### Masters of the Arcane

A mage, though possessed of an auspicious birthright, is not born, they are made. Becoming a mage involves tremendous dedication to mastering the advanced theory and intricate subtleties of the arcane. Such commitment can border on obsession, and a mage often measures their life in spells mastered and secrets gleaned. With lifespans greatly extended by the eldritch caress of the arcane, a mage may spend centuries practicing their craft and even create new spells that carry on their name. 

Because of their dedication to their craft, few mages can be found engaged in a livelihood that does not involve their powers. Mages who run shops sell enchanted items and potions, or simply offer their spellcasting services for a fee.  Before the Great Devastation, mages could be found lecturing at academies or advising wealthy nobles on matters of the arcane, but those days passed with the flames that consumed the arcane institutions.  Due to the broad applications of magic and the extended lifespan of a mage, many are also experts in various fields such as natural science and statecraft, making them wellsprings of knowledge to anyone with the coin to secure their services.

### Creating a mage

When creating a mage, think about how you came into your power. Were your parents or grandparents mages, and there was little surprise that the gift passed to you? Or were you already apprenticed to a local tradesman when the awakening of your powers changed the trajectory of your life forever? Do you have an uncommonly strong gift, or are you sufficiently talented as to keep up with your peers through superior technique? 

How do you feel about your gift? Do you revel in the power, or do you fear that it is actually a curse? Do you believe it was granted to you for a reason, or is it merely a result of the vagaries of fate? 

What drew you from the safety and comfort of your library or laboratory? Are you seeking mysteries gleaned from your research? Are you trying to complete the work of your late mentor? 

```
```

\page

### Spellcasting

Magic is your birthright and it suffuses your entire being. Your spells are fuelled by an innate font of power which you learn to wield through study and practice. 

Unlike other spellcasters who obtain their power through external means, your magic is inherent and does not rely on verbal, somatic, or material components, except where such components are the focus of the spell (such as a wooden chest for  *Leomund's secret chest* or the powdered silver and iron that is used to draw a *magic circle*). If a spell requires a  focus, such as *scrying*, you still require the focus to cast the spell.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the mage table. 

#### Spells Known

At 1st level, you know several 1st level spells of your choice:  3 + your intelligence bonus.  Every time you gain a level, you have the ability learn a number of new spells per level equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), which can be of any level that you can cast.

#### Casting Spells

Every time you gain a level, you roll for new spell points, much like you roll for new hit points: You get 1d4+4 spell points per level + your Intelligence modifier.  To cast one of your known spells, you must expend a number of spell points determined by the level of the spell you are casting (see the Spell Point Cost table, below). If you reduce your spell point total to 0, you gain a level of exhaustion. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to to cast a maximum of one spell of each level above 5th until you take a long rest. If you attempt to cast another spell of the same level before taking a long rest, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + the level at which you are casting the spell). If you fail the saving throw, you take 1d6 points of necrotic damage for each level of the spell. If you succeed the saving throw, you take half damage. If you survive the damage, the spell is successful.

If you cast a spell with insufficient spell points to pay for its cost, you subtract your total remaining spell points from the spell's cost and suffer 1d6 necrotic damage for every unpaid spell point remaining. For example, if you have four spell points and attempt to cast a 3rd level spell, which costs five spell points, you would take 1d6 necrotic damage. If you survive this damage, the spell succeeds. 

If your Intelligence score increases or decreases over the course of your career and your modifier changes, your spell point total increases or decreases in accordnce with the modifier change.

```
```

##### Spell Point Cost

<div style='column-count:2'>

| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |

```
```


| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 6th | 9 |
| 7th | 10 |
| 8th | 11 |
| 9th | 13 |


</div>


#### Learning Spells

When you gain the ability to learn new spells, you do not automatically gain these new spells; you must research them, either by consulting with another mage that already knows the spell, by copying them from another mage's spellbook or scroll, or by doing original research.  If you are working with another mage, their level and specialization do not matter, as long as they can communicate the spell to you.  If you do not have immediate access to new spells when you gain a level, you can hold on to your new spell slots for whenever you get the opportunity to learn a spell.  At 3rd level, you gain the Magical Research class feature, which enables you to research and learn a spell without another mage or spellbook to copy from.

The process of learning a new spell of 1st level or higher takes 1d4 days of research, practice, and study per spell level, minus your Intelligence bonus (minimum of 1 day).  At the end of this period of study, you need to make an Intelligence check to see if you learn it; if you fail the check, you can try again the following day (although there is no other penalty).  The DC for a spell is 5 plus the spell's level, plus your Intelligence bonus.  If the spell is on the general mage spell list or your specialization's spell list, you can also add your proficiency bonus to the check.  If you are working with another mage, you can add their proficiency bonus to the check as well, as they can guide you through the process of learning the spell and help correct mistakes.  If your total bonus to learn a spell is greater than the DC of the check, you still need to spend the time, but you can assume the check passed.

The process for learning a new cantrip is much simpler, and does not require practice or study: Cantrips are simple enough that a mage can learn them spontaneously and without training.

Any time you gain or lose points on your Intelligence score, you gain or lose the appropriate number of spells that you know, starting with those most recently learned.  For this reason, mages often record the spells they know in a spellbook, so that they can relearn them later in case the unthinkable happens. 

\page

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

> ##### Spellbooks?
> Unlike other campaign settings, where a spellcaster is beholden to their book of spells, in Gaia, there is no such limitation.  When a mage learns a spell, it is committed to their long-term memory, and becomes part of their being.  They have no need to prepare their spells at the beginning of the adventuring day, and they cannot exchange the spells they know for other spells when they gain levells.
>
> Even though mages do not require a spellbook to store their spells, many keep one anyway:  There are several ways that mages can forget spells that they know, including losing points from their Intelligence score or certain types of magical damage.  If spells are recorded, then they can be relearned when the mage restores their Intelligence score to its former glory or gains another level.
>
> Because mgaes are so rare, and finding spells can be difficult, finding another mage's spellbook is possibly the best treasure a mage can find.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for mage spells, as you manipulate natural laws in a carefully-planned manner. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___
- **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier


#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.  Casting a spell of 6th level or higher as a ritual removes the requirement that you make Constitution check, and multiple can be cast in a single day.

### Arcane Recovery

You are able to draw from the latent magic in the environment to replenish your power reserves. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain expended spell points equal to the cost of a spell of the highest level you can cast, to a maximum of 9 spell points. 

For example, if you're a 4th-level mage, you can recover up to 3 expended spell points (the cost of a 2nd-level spell). 

### Arcane Sense

The presence of magic resonates deeply with you.  Unless a spell effect is concealed (such as with *Nystul's magic aura*), you are automatically aware of the presence of magic or magical effects within 30 feet of you.

Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can open your perception to investigate such forces more intently. You may cast *detect magic* without expending any spell points and requiring no verbal, somatic, or material components.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Magical Research

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to recreate spells from your specializations spell list.  This means you can learn spells on your own without needing an external resource.  You can attempt to research and create a spell of a any level that you can cast.  The time to research a spell is the same as the time to learn it from another mage (see the Learning New Spells section).  Depending on the spell, this research might require access to a library and materials.

\page


### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternately, you can choose to forgo the ability score increase and take a Feat instead.

### Spell Mastery

Starting at 11th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you are able to cast them with little effort.  Choose a 1st-level spell that is in your spellbook:  You can cast it at half the standard spell point cost.  At 15th level, you can choose a 2nd level spell, and at 18th, you can choose a 3rd level spell.

If you cast a mastered spell at a higher level, you must complete a short or long rest to be able to do so again at half the standard spell point cost.  By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange the spells you chose for different spells of the same level.

## Arcane Tradition

Even the most accomplished mage cannot hope to master all the infinite intricacies of magic. Most mages inevitably specialize their studies toward one arcane tradition. Their dedication in one area over others leads them to develop a number of talents unique to their chosen field.

The most common arcane traditions are centred around the eight schools of magic, a convention of arcane theory that groups spells into distinct categories according to their function. While the underlying force behind one spell is the same magic that powers another, the practice of shaping that magic into certain effects alters the mystical energy fundamentally. 

A mage's choice of arcane tradition reveals more about their nature than their strategy. Individual magi are drawn to a school of magic to which they have an affinity. Often enough a mage can supply a practical reason for their preference, for each school has unique strengths over others, but the simple truth is that a mage's personality and the character of their specialization are usually in alignment because a mage's personal and mystical nature are deeply intertwined. 

Because a mage has a deep-seated inclination toward a specific school over others, they are also naturally at odds with a school that opposes their specialization. Each school of magic has a counter-school, a tradition that operates in a manner that contradicts or negates its functions, and which is naturally contradicted or negated in turn. While a mage will learn magic of their own specialization much more quickly, they will be slower to master the principles of the opposing school. See the "Schools of Magic" sidebar for more information. 

```
```

### School of Abjuration

The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.

Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.

Abjuration is in opposition to evocation, as evocation seeks to impose the mage's will on others while abjuration seeks to guard against external influence. 

#### Abjuration Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved and you can prepare abjuration spells in half the normal time. 

However, the time required to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare evocation spells. 

#### Arcane Ward

Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell at 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your mage level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. 

While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell at 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Projected Ward

Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

#### Improved Abjuration

Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in *counterspell* and *dispel magic*) , you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

#### Spell Resistance

Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

\page

### School of Conjuration

As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.

Conjuration is in opposition to necromancy, as conjuration follows the principle of creation and necromancy is a force of perversion and destruction. 


#### Conjuration Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved and you can prepare conjuration spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare necromancy spells. 


#### Minor Conjuration
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or  on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.

The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.


#### Benign Transposition
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell at 1st level or higher.


#### Focused Conjuration
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.


#### Durable Summons
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.

```
```

### School of Divination

The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

Divination is in opposition to illusion, as divination seeks to reveal the truth and illusion seeks to conceal or misrepresent it. 

#### Divination Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare divination spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare illusion spells. 

#### Portent
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.


#### Expert Divination
Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell at 2nd level or higher using spell points, you spend only half the necessary spell points. 

#### The Third Eye
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest. 

*** Darkvision. *** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

*** Ethereal Sight. *** You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.

*** Greater Comprehension. *** You can read any language.

*** See Invisibility. *** You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.


#### Greater Portend
Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.

\page

> ##### The Schools of Magic
> Arcane societies group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly magi, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study, innate talent, or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to them. 
>
> ** Abjuration ** spells are protective in nature, though some
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures
to other planes of existence.
>
> ** Conjuration ** spells involve the transportation of objects
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells
summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some
conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
>
> ** Divination ** spells reveal information, whether in the form of
secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations
of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of
distant people or places.
>
> ** Enchantment ** spells affect the minds of others, influencing
or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies
see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of
action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
>
> ** Evocation ** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a
desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others
channel positive energy to heal wounds.
>
> ** Illusion ** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They
cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things
that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember
things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom
images that any creature can see, but the most insidious
illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
>
> ** Necromancy**  spells manipulate the energies of life and
death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force,
drain the life energy from another creature, create the
undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells
such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters
use such spells frequently.
>
> ** Transmutation ** spells change the properties of a creature,
object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a
harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an
object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s
innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

```
```


### School of Enchantment
As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.

Enchantment is in opposition to transmutation, as enchantment builds upon the foundations of reality while transmutation undermines and reshapes it anew. 

#### Enchantment Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare enchantment spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare transmutation spells. 


#### Hypnotic Gaze
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your mage spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.



#### Instinctive Charm
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your mage spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.

You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

\page

#### Split Enchantment
Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.




#### Alter Memories
At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.

Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) . You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

  style='width:325px' />


```
```

### School of Evocation

You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

Evocation is in opposition with abjuration, as evocation seeks to manifest the mage's will and abjuration seeks to negate it. 

#### Evocation Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare evocation spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare abjuration spells. 

#### Sculpt Spells
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. 

#### Potent Cantrip
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

#### Empowered Evocation
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any mage evocation spell you cast.

#### Overchannel
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a mage spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before  finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12 . This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

### School of Illusion
You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists—including many gnome magi—are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

Illusion is in opposition to divination because illusion views the truth subjectively while divination seeks the objective facts. 

#### Illusion Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare illusion spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare divination spells. 

#### Improved Minor Illusion
When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the *minor illusion* cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different mage cantrip of yourchoice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast *minor illusion*, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

#### Malleable Illusions
Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion) , provided that you can see the illusion.

#### Illusory Self
Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Illusory Reality
By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell at 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

```

### School of Necromancy
The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.

Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

Necromancy is in opposition to conjuration, as necromancy is the study of death while conjuration is concerned with life. 

#### Necromancy Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare necromancy spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare conjuration spells.

#### Grim Harvest
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell cast at 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

#### Undead Thralls
At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast animate dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton,
as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:
* The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your mage level.
* The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

#### Inured to Death
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

#### Command Undead

Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other magi. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your mage spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

### School of Transmutation
You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.

Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.

Transmutation is in opposition to enchantment, as enchantment is preoccupied with what already exists while transmutation considers what could be. 

#### Transmutation Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved and you prepare transmutation spells in half the normal time.

However, the time required to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is doubled, and you take twice as long to prepare enchantment spells.


#### Minor Alchemy
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone) , iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure,  you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

#### Transmuter's Stone

Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. 



When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
* Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet
* An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered
* Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
* Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)

Each time you cast a transmutation spell at 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.


#### Shapechanger
At 10th level, you add the *polymorph* spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast *polymorph* with a cost of 1 spell point. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

Once you cast *polymorph* in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using available spell points.


#### Master Transmuter
Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a long rest.

***Major Transformation.*** You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.

***Panacea.*** You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.

***Restore Life.*** You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending spell points or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.

***Restore Youth.*** You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.


### The Universal School
You are fascinated and drawn to magic of all different schools. Your research draws wider connections between all manifestations of the arcane, granting you unparalleled versatility and vision in your spellcasting endeavours. 

Magi without an affinity to a traditional magical school are rarer even than diviners and can achieve remarkable balance in their studies. While they lose out on some of the benefits gained by their peers, they find other advantages in their flexibility. 

A mage who follows this arcane tradition has no opposing schools.

#### Arcane Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the time you must spend to copy spells into your spellbook is reduced by one quarter and you prepare spells in three-quarters the normal time.

#### Spell Maven
Beginning when you choose this school at 2nd level, you may add your proficiency bonus when calculating the number of spells you can have prepared. 

#### Improved Spellcasting
Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a spell that cast at higher levels for an additional or improved effect, the spell is cast at one level higher than the level for which you paid spell points. This effect cannot increase a spell's level above 9th. 

#### Arcane Genius
At 10th level, you gain an ability granted by a different Arcane Tradition which normally becomes available at 6th level or lower. 

#### Master of the Arcane
Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier to the number of spell points recovered when you use Arcane Recovery. 

Additionally, when you cast a spell that requires you to make an ability check as part of casting that spell (as in *counterspell* and *dispel magic*) , you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check. 

```

> ##### Arcane Focus
> An arcane focus is a special item—an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item—designed to channel the power of arcane spells. It is not necessary for a mage to possess an arcane focus in order to cast spells, but powerful focuses such as *wands of the war wizard* can enhance the potency of a mage's power. 
>
>An arcane focus can also function in place of a special focus for a spell if it roughly approximates the form of the focus called for by the spell. For example, a crystal focus could serve as the spell focus when casting the *clairvoyance* spell.
