# Rogue

Rogues live by their wits and cleverness, instead of brute strength or hard work.  Scouts, acrobats, and circus performers fall into this category, as do thieves and con men.

Rogues are identical to their PHB counterparts, with these exceptions:  The Arcane Trickster archetype is not available.  The Scout archetype is also available.
