The Circle of Twilight is composed of druids who take an active role in the defense of nature and adopt partial aspects of beasts while retaining they’re humanoid form. True masters of this circle have even developed the ability to adopt features of truly supernatural beasts, such as Bulette or Wyverns.

Sometimes known as Wardens or Geomancers, these warriors walk the line between man and monster, and use their prowess for the greater good.

#### Circle of Twilight Features

| Druid Level | Feature |
| :--------- | :------ |
| 2nd  | Aspect of the Wild (2 aspects), Bonus Cantrips, Fighting Style |
| 6th  | Aspect of the Wild (3 aspects), Extra Attack  |
| 10th | Aspect of the Wild (4 aspects), Persistent Aspect |
| 14th | Aspect of the Wild (5 aspects), Natural Vigor |

#### Aspect of the Wild

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can use Wildshape to gain specific animalistic or monstrous features while retaining your humanoid form.

You learn two Wild Aspects of your choice, which are detailed in the “Wild Aspects” section below. You learn an additional Wild Aspect of your choice at 6th level and again at 10th level, and 14th level.

Whenever you learn a new wild aspect, you can also replace one wild aspect that you already know with a different aspect. 

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wildshape to gain the benefits of your Wild Aspects instead of using Beast Shape. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

#### Bonus Cantrips

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn the *primal savagery* and *shillelagh* cantrips, if you don't already know them.

#### Fighting Style

Also at 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.  Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 

***Archery.*** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

***Dueling.*** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

***Two-Weapon Fighting.*** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Extra Attack

At 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of just once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Persistent Aspect

Starting at 10th level, you are adept at continuously maintaining a particular wild aspect. When you gain this feature, choose one Wild Aspect that you know. That aspect becomes permanent.

#### Natural Vigor

At 14th level, when you gain one or more Wild Aspects, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.
