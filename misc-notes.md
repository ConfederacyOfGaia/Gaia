## Dungeoncast e30: Crafting a Campaign

*https://soundcloud.com/thedungeoncast/dungeon-mastering-crafting-a-campaign-the-dungeoncast-ep30*

* ***Important:*** Ensure all players know the background of the setting: history, religion, geography, etc
* Type of game?  End of World?  Political?  Murder-mystery?  etc
* [Golden Sun](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/Iwf0TAUe8g3EbucjTMiPVLNWoU8AUo5f) -- investigate
* Start with a villian; a story is only as good as its villain.
  * Create backstory, and villian's goal, and then work backwards
    * When you flesh out the BBEG enough, the motivation and events often write themselves
    * The BBEG's enemies are potential allies for the PCs
  * Players usually want to play what you've created for them, so usually no need to railroad them towards your planned final boss fight
  * Once you've worked back far enough, you find your hook for the players
  * 
* With new characters, ask them how they want to know each other
  * Friends, family
  * Perhaps they've all signed up for the same job
  * PCs are all part of the same org/guild
    * Maybe they've been assigned to the job by the guildmaster, e.g., Agents of SHEILD
* Don't get married to a specific villain or NPC; PCs might take it in a different direction.
* Plan chain of events in advance, which helps to keep the action moving in the right direction
  * Can be used to bring the PCs back on track if they divert
* "Welcome to the part of the show where we don't talk about what we were talking about" i.e., intermission
  * [Hero Forge](https://www.heroforge.com/) custom minis, very fucking cool
* Dungeons - in D&D, a dungeon is any explorable area
  * Forests, tunnels, pretty much anything can be a dungeon
  * Mountains with a tunnel system through it, like Moria
  * Thei history of your world defines how many exist
  * How many of them are manmade?
  * Dungeons exist in real life, too -- e.g., bunkers and stuff
* Start small, sandboxed to a small region at first
  * Small story arc, small mission, smaller goal
  * Work up to a larger arc, if you think you need one or it evolves from the PCs actions
  * An approach that can work is character-based:  Each PC has their own arc
    * Makes the work the players put into their characters worth it
    * Work each PC's arc into a single over-arching arc
* Another option: Start huge
  * "The tarrasque apears, fucks up the town, and leaves.  What do you do?"
  * Another option:  The catastrophe is incidental, but acts as a catalyst.  E.g., the tarasque disappears but tore a hole into the Underdark, which is now spewing evil into the city.
* Episodical campaigns, especially good when not everyone can join every time
  * Good for a guild or org scenario
  * "Vault Raiders" -- adventurers guild (this allows players to switch characters for one-off missions)
  * These can be disconnected, so if someone is missing it's not a problem
  * Could be worked into Gaia as a guild, cleaning up goblin or kobold settlements
* Shows and movies are a great inspiration for campaigns, especially episodic campaigns
* Don't just role play *characters*, role play the *environment*
* 

## Dungeoncast e7: World Building

*https://soundcloud.com/thedungeoncast/dungeon-mastering-world-buidling-the-dungeoncast-ep7*

* A world can have multiple continents, each one of which is completely different
* No need to build *everything* to start -- pick a single country or area and then expand on it
* Are usually an amalgamation of all the fantasy stuff I like
* Start with a map!
  * investigate inkarnate
  * starting with geograhpy often inspires creativity
* Come up with some good ideas and then work backwards from there to the cities and kingdoms
* [Orichalcum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orichalcum)
* Many people arrange their world around a *theme*, which informs most of the decisions
* ***If I had to choose again, there would be no magic in Gaia.  Nature magic, psionics, and the force only.***
