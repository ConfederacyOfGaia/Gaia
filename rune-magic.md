# Rune Magic

## What is rune magic?

Idea:  The runmage expends all but one point fo the cost of casting a spell, and imbues that into the runecarven object itself.  To actually invoke the rune, the runemage spends the last point, and the effect takes place, centered on wherever the runecarven object is.  If the runecarven object is in the runemage's posession, then they can direct the effect (if that makes sense).
