### Zephyran Mage

The magic of the Great Dragons has begun to fill the world, and you were lucky enough (or unfortunate enough) to have absorbed some of it.  Perhaps your powers manifested at a very young age, or perhaps there was a recent triggering event that brought out your powers; in either case, you can command magic and cast spells.

The peoples of the former Zephyran Empire associate magic with the Great Dragons and the devastation they wrought, so they tend to not trust anyone who can wield magic.

A Zephyran Mage evokes magic by force of will, and does not need to expend material components when casting spells, unless the component has a cost or is the target or focus of the spell.

#### Don't Quit Your Day Job

There are no professional magic wielders, which means you have the standard set of adventuring skills in addition to your spellcasting abilities, and you probably dress as a warrior or commoner.  At 1st level, you gain proficiency with light armor and simple weapons, and your hit die becomes a d8 instead of a d6.  Your list of skill choices changes to **Arcana**, **Deception**, **History**, **Insight**, **Investigation**, **Nature**, **Perception**, and **Survival**.

#### The Moons are a Harsh Mistress

The strength of your magic waxes and wanes with the cycles of the moons.

- When both Osis and Lira are aligned during a High Confluence, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1.
- When both Osis and Lira are aligned during a Low Confluence, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.

#### Unreliable Magic

Arcane magic is not well understood, and your spells have a chance to backfire. Every time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20.  If you roll equal to the spell's level, the spell fizzles and the spell slot is wasted.  If you roll less than the spell's level, the spell backfires, and the spell affects someone other than its intended target.  If there are multiple possible targets within range, roll a die of the closest size to determine who is affected.  Do not include your intended target, but do include yourself, unless you were the intended target.

#### Arcane Sensitivity

Your magical heritage and training makes you more sensitive to its presence. Whenever you are within 30 feet of magic of any kind, there is a chance that you will notice it equal to your passive **Arcana (Charisma)** score.  You can also extend your awareness around you, as an Action, by making an **Arcana (Charisma)** check.

The DC of the magic depends on its strength: For spells, the DC is 20 - the spell's level.  For magic items, the stronger the magic, the more likely you are to notice it. Use the following table:

|Rarity   |DC |
|:--------|:-:|
|Common   |20 |
|Uncommon |18 |
|Rare     |15 |
|Very Rare|12 |
|Legendary|10 |

This only applies to magical effects that are hidden or otherwise not obvious, including spells that a creature is concentrating on.  Your chances to notice obvious magical effects are unchanged.

#### Bend Reality

Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the raw forces of magic to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.  Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, when you make an Unreliable Magic roll, you can choose to roll with disadvange. You then regain the use of this feature.

#### Improved Font of Magic

When you gain the **Font of Magic** feature at 2nd level, you regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when making an Unreliable Magic roll, you can expend sorcery points equal to the spell's level to gain advantage on that roll.  This can be used to offset disadvantage from the Bend Reality feature.

#### Monkey See, Monkey Do

At 6th level, when you see another creature cast a spell, there is a chance you can learn to recreate that spell's effect if it is of a level for which you have spell slots.  Make an **Arcana (Charisma)** check, the DC of which is 15 + the spell's level.  On success, you learn the spell temporarily and can cast it once before you complete a long rest.  You must expend a sorcerer spell slot to cast the spell in this way, and you can have a number of spells held in reserve equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

Additionally, starting at 6th level, whenever you learn a new sorcerer spell, you can choose to learn a spell that you have successfully recreated in the past, even if it is not on your spell list.  The spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, or a cantrip.  The chosen spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you.

#### Amplified Magic

Also at 6th level, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of any sorcerer spell you cast.

#### Turning Magic Into Luck

You learn to channel your magic to protect yourself from harm. Beginning at 14th level, when you need to make a saving throw, you can expend a spell slot to gain a bonus on the roll.  You gain a +1 for each level of the spell slot you expend.
