# The Confederacy of Gaia

**The Confederacy of Gaia** is the name of the kingdom in which our intrepid heroes live.  It is one kingdom of several on a large continent.  The continent is divided into several regions:

* [The Zephyrlands](zephyrlands.md), in the western half of the continent.  The Confederacy of Gaia is here, along with several neighboring countries.
* [The Thundersnow Tundra](thundersnow-tundra.md), in the north, which consists of frigid deserts.
* The [East](east.md), about which the PCs know nothing.
* The [South and Central areas](central.md), which consists of immense mountains, and are home to the Orcs.

Most of the currently existing materials cover the western half of the continent, centered on [The Zephyrlands](zephyrlands.md).  There are a few other kingdoms in The Zephyrlands, but they will primarily be supporting players in the action.

This repository contains information about the campaign world, including the [player's overview of The Zephyrlands](zephyrlands.md).  All of these are written in [homebrewery](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/)-compatible markdown, intended to be published there, but maintained here for version control.

## Game mechanics

* [Character creation](character-creation.md) provides an overview of the character creation process, as well as a high-level overview of the types of classes that are available.

* Classes

  * As the world gains more definition, I might find a way to integrate the other classes, but it is not a priority for me right now.
* [Equipment](equipment.md) - Weapons, armor, equipment, and items, with descriptions.  The avaialbility tables here override the tables in the PHB.
* [Feats](feats.md) - Feats are a mandatory part of the game, and this pages lists the available ones.
* [Magic](magic.md) - All about the magic of Gaia and its mechanics.

I'm also keeping a [running list](TODO.md) of the things that need to be finished, defined, or clarified in order to make the world playable.
