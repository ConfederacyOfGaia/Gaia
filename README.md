# Gaia

**Gaia** is the name of the campaign world as a whole.

The continent is divided into several logical regions:

* [The Zephyrlands](zephyrlands.md), in the western halfof the continent, where the PCs begin their adventures.
* [The Thundersnow Tundra](thundersnow-tundra.md), in the north, which consists of frigid deserts.
* The [East](east.md), about which the PCs know nothing.
* The [South and Central areas](central.md), which consists of immense mountains, and are home to the Orcs.

Most of the currently existing materials cover the western half of the continent, centered on [The Zephyrlands](zephyrlands.md).  There are a few other countries around The Zephyrlands, but they will primarily be supporting players in the action.

This repository contains information about the campaign world, including the [player's overview of The Zephyrlands](zephyrlands.md).  All of these are written in [homebrewery](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/)-compatible markdown, intended to be published there, but maintained here for version control.
