# Gaia

**Gaia** is the name of the campaign world.


The continent as a whole has several major sections:

* The [West](west.md), where the PCs begin their adventures.
* The [North](north.md), which consists of frigid deserts.
* The [East](east.md), about which the PCs know nothing.
* The [South and Central areas](central.md), which consists of impassible mountains, and are home to the Orcs.

Most of the currently existing materials cover the [western half of the continent](west.md), which is where the adventures take place.

This repository contains information about the campaign world, including the [player's overview of the west](west.md).  All of these are written in [homebrewery](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/)-compatible markdown, intended to be published there, but maintained here for version control.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a map of the entire continent
  - [ ] Concentrate on the Western and Central areas; the rest can be left as Terra Incognito
- [ ] Create names for:
  - [ ] The western and eastern halves of the continent as a whole
    - [ ] Rename west.md, east.md, etc once these are defined
  - [ ] The name of the mountain ranges in the center of the continent
  - The geopolitical structure of the west
    - [ ] A small number of well-defined countries on the borders of the playing area
    - [ ] The playing area itself is the confederacy of city-states that I've been defining all along
  - [ ] The countries in the western half of the continent
- [ ] Define the cultures of the countries in the west
  - [ ] Different countries will have different languages
  - [ ] Make sure that races and cultures are separate, and individually defined.  When creating a character, the combination of race, country of origin, and background define your ABIs, skills, proficiencies, and starting Feats.
- [ ] Create an overarching, western-wide history, culminating with the Great Devastation of recent memory that led to the current situation
- Changes to magic
  - [ ] Druidic magic is tied to specific regions:  The west, the northern desert, the central mountains, or the eastern plains.  These correspond to druidic circles, and will need to have well-defined borders and overlaps.  A druid's power is attuned to their particular region, so druids have fewer spell points etc as they move farther away from the area of their circle.
  - [ ] Arcane magic is still very rare
  - [ ] Arcane magic might express itself completely differently in the east
    - [ ] Is there a way to utilize Jedis, Mystics, or Elementalists?
