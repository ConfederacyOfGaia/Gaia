*The **Zephyrlands** covers the western half of the continent **Enda** of a world called **Corrin**, and it consists of several indepedent regions that are all part of the **Aurelian Empire**. Until recently, these regions were part of the **Zephyran Empire**, but the Zephyran Empire was conquered 32 winters ago when the **Great Dragons** came from the east with their armies of dragonborn, ushering in the **Age of the Great Dragons**.*

## A Short History

For as long as anyone can remember, humans, elves, and goliaths lived peacefully in the temperate lands of western Enda, and developed advanced civilizations. At the beginning of recorded history, a great warrior united all the human tribes between the **Sunbloom Mountains** in the east and the **Sinaran Ocean** in the west.  The center of his empire was on **Mount Zephyra**, which sits in the middle of the land, and, for hundreds of years, his dynasty ruled the **Zephyran Empire**. The Zephyran Emperors ruled fairly, coorperating with the neighboring elves and goliaths and allowing their peoples to mostly govern themselves. They instilled in their empire a veneration for nature, the cycles of the peoples mirrored the seasons, and the Zephyrans lived close to the land.

Then, when your parents were children, the **Great Dragons** and their armies of dragon soldiers emerged from the Sunbloom Mountains, crushing everything in their path, driving the goliaths of the eastern hills towards the sea, and completely toppling the Zephyran Empire. The armies of the Great Dragons conquered the great cities and decimated the complacent forces of the Zephyran Empire, and the Great Golden Dragon instituted a new regime over all of western Enda: The **Aurelian Empire**.

The Great Golden Dragon quickly established order, stationing its dragonborn as officials and soldiers in every settlement of the former Zephyran Empire. It mandated worship of Bahamut and veneration of Tiamat, the personfications of Order and Freedom, and erected shrines to them in every city.

Despite its tumultuous beginning, the Aurelian Empire has been good for the peoples of the Zephyrlands.  The Great Golden Dragon is a strict but fair ruler, allowing the peoples of the former Zephyran Empire a great deal of autonomy, as long as they follow the **Edicts of the Great Golden Dragon**.

In this way, the Zephyrans slowly rebuilt from the ashes of their former freedom, and coalesced around tribal lines, under the thumb of the Aurelian Empire. In the decades since the Great Dragons emerged, these provinces have enjoyed a cautious peace, interspersed with border skirmishes, land disputes, and the occasional goblinoid raid.

The goliaths never returned to their ruined homelands. Instead, they settled throughout the Empire and integrated into the flow of Zephyran life.  The elves, always reclusive, made themselves even more scarce, retreating to their traditional homelands in the forest and tundra.

## Geography

The Zephyrlands cover a vast amount of land and a wide array of climates.

**Mount Zephyra** sits in the center, and lends its name to both the former Zephyran Empire and the common name of the region, the Zephyrlands.

**The Confederacy of Gaia** occupies the center of western Enda, surrounding Mount Zephyra on all sides.  It consists of 11 great cities, loosely allied and connected via trade routes and a shared history.

The **Sunbloom Mountains** are a massive mountain range to the east, impossibly steep and impassable by all but the most experienced mountaineers.

The **Sinarin Ocean** runs the western length of the continent.

**Kylf** lies to the northeast of Mount Zephyra. It is a land of rolling hills, renowned for its horses.

The **Thundersnow Tundra** lies to the north, and stretches from the Sinarin Ocean to the east past the Sunbloom Mountains.

The **Soothills** lie to the southeast of Mount Zephyra.  Their actual name is the **Onoklat Hills**.  This is a burned-out wasteland where nothing grows, completely destroyed by dragonfire when the armies emerged from the Sunbloom Mountains.  The land of **Esh** was once nestled in the Soothills, but since the destruction of their homeland, the Eshen have taken to wandering the Aurelian Empire in nomadic caravans.

The **Sea of Fallen Stars** is a large, land-locked body of water in the middle of the continent, north of **Mount Zephyra** and south of the **Thundersnow Tundra**.

### Moons

Corrin has two moons, ***Osis*** and ***Lira***, which form the basis of how time is kept.  Lira, known the Dark Moon because it glows very faintly compared to Osis, orbits Corrin every 12 days, which is known as a week.  Osis, the Light Moon, has a 28 day cycle, which is how months are tracked.

<!--
- Osis and Lira are manifestations of Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively.
- **AI** Convert the Dragonlance lunar calendar to this world.  Osis has a 28-day cycle [Nuitari], and Lira has a 12-day cycle [Lunitari].

## The Aurelian Empire

The Great Golden Dragon makes its home on the top of Mount Zephyra, which was the seat of the Zephyran Empire for centuries.  After the conquest of the Zephyran Empire, the Great Golden Dragon installed its armies of dragonborn in every settlement throughout its Empire, where their job is to keep peace and oversee affairs.

The change in ruler hasn't affected the daily life of Zephyrans much.  They still work their fields, or tend to their their herds, or sell their wares, only now they do so under the watchful eyes of the ubiquitous dragonborn soldiers.  Troublemakers are dealt with quickly, and the areas immediately around the villages and towns are a little safer.

The Empire has a series of permanent trade routes, that it uses to distribute news and goods from the heart of the Empire.  Armored caravans make the rounds throughout the Empire hitting every settlement at least once per week, so news and rumors are never too old.  These caravans are heavily guarded, because in addition to carrying news and Imperial declarations, they also transport mail, collect taxes, and bring any collected precious metals back to the Great Golden Dragon itself.

## Culture

The Zephyrlands consists of several mostly-independant regions.  Before the Aurelian Empire, they were all part of the Zephyran Empire, so they share a culture and a common language, flavored with the regional differences that are left over from the pre-imperal kingdoms.

The peoples of the continent are collectively called Zephyrans. They share a language, also called Zephyran, though some regions have their own language as well. Most people strongly identify with their home town or village, rather than their kingdom or the current Empire.

Zephyran culture centers around nature, and the rhythms of day to day life are bound up with the seasons, the harvests, and the moons. These patterns are woven into everyday life, and influence most things.

Community life is very important in the Zephyranlands.  Every town and city has communal dining halls where the population meets every evening for a shared meal.  These communal dining halls are managed by dedicated professionals, who are held in high respect.  Farmers and herders primarily provide their products to their village or town, where they are used for common meals and community events.

Before the coming of the Great Dragons, every permanent settlement of any size had a dedicated **caretaker**: a druid who would watch over the town and perform the ceremonies and services at each harvest, planting, solstice, equinox, and confluence of the moons.  These caretakers are much less common since worship of Bahamut and Tiamat was instituted, but they still hold poitions of importance in community life.  The Edicts of the Great Golden Dragon don't outlaw the old practices, so caretakers are treated with respect &mdash; so long as they don't promote ideas that violate the Edicts.

### Provinces, Towns, Villages

There are a handful of large cities throughout the continent. Gaia is called a *confederacy* because each of its 11 cities houses a powerful lord, who ostensibly controls the villages around his land, called a province. These provinces correspond to the noble houses for the former Zephyran Empire.

Besides these cities, towns and villages are the main urban unit, and they are scattered around the Zephyrlands, clustering near geographical features like rivers and major crossroads. A village will have a large exurban population: the homes and land of the farmers, ranchers, and herders who call the village their home, and who gather in the village every evening for the communal meal and to contribute their resources. A town is usually several villages that have grown large enough that their borders overlapped.

\page

Each town or village has the things you would expect: a general store, maybe a few other stores, a common house (inn, tavern, and stables), local government offices (which, since the Aurelian Empire was established, are populated completely by dragonborn), and a central temple to Bahamut and Tiamat, as mandated by the Great Golden Dragon's Edicts. A larger town will have multiple of each. Every settlement has one or more communal dining halls where the population meets every evening for a shared meal.  There will also be other buildings, shops, houses, and so on, especially to house the middle classes (merchants, artisans, craftsmen, etc).

The commoners live in farm houses proximal to their home villages, with their farmlands, pastures, and orchards surrounding their homes. Artisans, craftsmen, and merchants will usually live in the village or town directly.

The cities and villages are generally on good terms with each other, and trade and travel between them is common, but this travel can be dangerous: bandits have been known to prey on defenseless travelers and rich caravans, despite the best efforts of the Empire's soldiers. Because Zephyrans rely so heavily on inter-village trade, finding work as a caravan guard is a good way for the young and strong to earn some money and establish their reputation.

Despite the heavy reliance on inter-village trade, most Zephyrans haven't traveled more than a few days away from their home village. They are often very interested in news from the outside world, and will listen to stories from anyone willing to share them.

Homes in the Zephyrlands tend to be short, squat, and wide, with low ceilings and wraparound porches, and gently-slanted roofs. Building materials depend on the resources in the area, but wood is the most common. Every house has a fireplace in it, as the focal point of household life. Beds tend to be wide and low, sometimes sitting directly on the floor or ground, and it's not uncommon for children to sleep bunched together. Larger farms and ranches are often collections of these buildings, connected by shared roofs and continuous porches.

### Demographics

The towns and villages of The Zephyrlands are primarily peopled by humans, with goliaths being common in Gaia and Kylf. Elves from the north occasionally travel throughout the confederacy, though they seldom settle in the villages and towns.  Other races are unknown in the Zephyrlands.


### Politics

The Great Golden Dragon has installed an imperial government with dragonborn representatives in every major settlement.  These officials act as the mayors, sheriffs, priests, and judges in the towns where they're installed. Humans are often involved in the government as local representatives; in theory, they have as much say in the affairs of the town, but, in practice, they are often ceremonial.

```
```

### Religion

Before the Aurelian Empire, gods were unknown in the Zephyrland.  Instead, the Zephyrans revered nature and the spirits of the land, guided by their caretakers.

The Great Golden Dragon mandated worship of Bahamut and veneration of Tiamat within the empire, and ordered that a temple be built in every town. These temples are magnificant structures, shaped like the open jaws of a dragon and inlaid with gold, platinum, and jewels.  There are monthly services when Osis is full and when Lira is full, and these are particularly extravagant when both are in High Confluence.


<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>


> #### Draconic Token
>
> Every citizen of the Aurelian Empire is given a ***Draconic Token***, a hexagonal pendant on about 2 inches in diameter.  This token is engraved with the bearer's name in Draconic (in the Elvish script) on the back and an identification rune on the front.  When entering a new town, a citizen is required to show their Draconic Token to enter.  Theft of another's token results in a month of hard labor.


<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### Regional Cultures

#### The Confederacy of Gaia

The Confederacy of Gaia occupies the temperate belt that runs through the center of the continent. The heart of the Zephyran Empire was in Gaia, on Mount Zephyra, and the language, culture, and traditions of Gaia are what the empire spread to its vassals.  The overall culture of the confederacy has a vaguely 18th-century Japan feel to it; most people are farmers, ranchers, and herders, and live simple, rural lives in tune with the rhythms of the land and organized around the seasons.

The population of Gaia consists mostly of humans, with a minority population of goliaths that immigrated after the Soothills were destroyed.

Gaian families tend to be large, and will live on the same plots of land for generations. Among farmers, ranchers, and herders, which are exclusively humans, the first born children will usually take over their parents' farm or ranch when they reach middle adulthood (about 30 years old), at which point the parents will mostly retire as honored elders. The other children will work on the family farms as well, although some will leave home and set up their own homestead or become craftsmen. There is work on the ranches and farms for children of all ages, starting with the very young, so all children learn their parents' line of work.

Artisans, craftsmen, and merchants make up the middle classes, which consist of both goliaths and humans. They tend to follow the same basic pattern as farmers and ranchers, though the families are smaller: The children are expected to apprentice to the parent's craft and take it over when they are adults, although artisans and craftsmen will usually work later into their middle age than farmers. Goliaths dislike farming and ranching, and make excellent and clever artisans and craftsmen.

***Languages.*** Zephyran.


\page


#### Esh

Esh was nestled in the Onoklot Hills, the region of the Zephyrlands that lay between the Sunbloom Mountains and Gaia. The Onoklot Hills were also the traditional homeland of the goliaths.  They held them separate from Esh, politically, but for all intents and purposes the two peoples formed one nation.

The Onoklot Hills, and Esh, were completely destroyed by the armies of the Great Dragons.  The surviving Eshen decided it was too much trouble to try to rebuild, and chose to simply leave their lands forever, endlessly wandering the Zephyrlands.  The goliaths chose to emigrate to the nearby lands of Gaia and Kylf.


Before its destruction, the people of Esh (goliath and Eshen alike) were fabled for their platinum-, gold-, and silversmiths. Some have hypothesized that this is why Esh was completely destroyed and looted by the dragonborn armies.

***Eshen Caravans.*** Eshen caravans are fairly small: Usually no more than 20 to 30 wagons, and under 200 people. Eshen are highly skilled craftsmen and artists, and trade their crafts and art for the food that they do not produce themselves. The Eshen were able to salvage much of their knowledge when they fled their burning lands; as a result, there are a large number of Eshen scholars, of all specializations. Every Eshen caravan has a library wagon.

The Eshen are known for their storytellers and minstrels.  They will be present in every caravan, and individual wandering Eshen bards are always welcome in any tavern, where they earn their keep by entertaining the locals with stories, music, and the occasional light show.

In addition to providing entertainment, Eshen caravans also function as traveling schools.  Whenever a caravan enters the outskirts of a village, the villagers will send their children to them to learn as much as they can: history, geography, the natural world, the sciences, and so forth.  These caravans sometimes stay in one place for as much as a month at a time.  The children will bring food and goods as payment for these lessons.

***Languages.*** Eshen speak their own language, called Eshen, as well as Zephyran. Many of them also speak elvish; as wanderers, they often find themselves traveling with elven travelers, and are on good terms with them.

#### Kylf

Kylf lies to the east and northeast of Gaia. It is a country of rolling hills, and southern Kylf butts up agains the Soothills, so it has a substantial population of goliaths of who immagrated after the destruction of the Soothills.

Most Kylves are herders and ranchers. Kylf produce the best horses in the Zephyrlands, renowned for their speed and bravery.  Kylven life centers around horses and ranching. Children grow up riding horses and most families own ranches. Common pasttimes are dressage, polo, and horse racing, which Kylves take very seriously.

The goliaths who settled in Kylf brought their smithing and crafting skills, and quickly established themselves as blacksmiths, woodworkers, carptenters, and so on, quickly becoming an essential part of the Kylven life.  Because of their size, they are too large for any but the largest of horses.

***Languages.*** Kylven, Zephyran.

#### Vella

The Vella live in the Thundersnow Tundra, in the northern reaches of Enda.  There are several distinct tribes, each of which is established in their own massive city.  Their daily lives revolve around the herds that they hunt, and they do not build cities.  They mostly keep to themselves, and most Zephyrans have never met a Vellan.

***Languages.*** Vellan, elvish.

### Languages

#### Spoken

- **Draconic.** The official language of the Aurelian Empire, spoken by the Great Golden Dragon and the dragonborn.  All official documents and communications from the Great Golden Dragon are in Draconic.  Despite this, not all Zephyrans learn the language, in the same way that not all Catholics learn Latin.
- **Elvish.** The forest and tundra dialects of the elven language are similar enough that an elf who speaks one can understand someone speaking the other, but they have different colloquialisms and local idioms.
- **Eshen.** The melodic, sing-songy language of Esh.  The Eshen language has a secret component, called **Vaneshen**, which the Eshen use to identify each other and covertly exchange information, similar to thieves cant.  This is never taught this to outsiders, even ones to whom they teach spoken and written Eshen.
- **Kylven.** The people of Kylf speak their own languag, which is very similar to Zephyran.
- **Giant.** The gutteral language of the giants and their kin.  Among the races of the Aurelian and Zephyran Empires, only goliaths speak it with regularity.
- **Vellan.** A harsh, monosyllabic language spoken by the humans of the Thundersnow Tundra.  Vellan does not have a written component.
- **Zephyran.** The main language of the former Zephyran Empire, spoken by most humans, goliaths, dragonborn, and many elves.

<!-- Introduce this once the players encounter goblinoids.
- **Goblish.** The language of the Orcs, also spoken by hobgoblins and orcs.  The written form uses Giant runes.
-->

#### Written Scripts

There are two forms of writing in use:

- The **Elvish alphabet**, which is used by Draconic, Elvish, Eshen, Kylven, and Zephyran.  While the letter forms are identical among all of these languages, the words and grammar are radically different.  Draconic traditionally has no written form, but the Great Golden Dragon embraced the Elvish alphabet as a method of writing it to distribute its Edicts.
- The Giant language is written using **hieroglyphic runes**.

#### Literacy

Most people in the Aurelian Empire are literate.  Traditionally, children were taught collectively at the communal centers in each village or town.  Since the coming of the Aurelian Empire, this is supplemented by traveling Eshen caravans that provide education wherever they travel.

A notable exception are the Vellan, because the Vellan language doesn't have a written component.

```
```

## Money and Wealth

Per Edict of the Great Golden Dragon, owning gold, silver, and platinum is illegal, so the **gilder** is the standard currency, maintained by the Zephyran Empire.  Gilders are minted as hexagonal cloisonne copper coins, about the size of a US quarter.  They have a hole in the middle and can be strung together on a cord; 50 gilders on a string are called a **clamp**.

Gilders come in the following denominations:

| Color | Value in gilders | Colloquial names
| :---- | :-----:          | :-----
| Black | 1/10             | *blacks*, *bits*
| Green | 1                | *greens*, *turtles*
| Blue  | 5                | *blues*
| Red   | 10               | *reds*
| Gold  | 100              | *golds*

Citizens can turn in any platinum, gold, or silver they find at any Imperial office.  The standard fee for turning these in is 1 gold for a platinum item, 1 red for a gold item, and 1 blue for a silver item.

A gilder, of any denomination, is a slender coin; 100 of them weigh 1 pound.

For conversions to PHB rates, 1 gilder = 1 gp, and 1 bit = 1 sp. Anything that costs less that 1 sp is rounded up to 1 sp.

## Time

- Years are tracked in **winters**.  There are the typical 4 seasons, each 3 months long.
- **Months** are tracked by the cycles of Osis, and are 28 days long.
- **Weeks** are tracked by the cycles of Lira, and are 12 days long.
- The **High Confluence** is when both Osis and Lira are full on the same night.  The overlapping light causes them each to appear as a bright light blue color, and is cause for great celebration.
- The **Low Confluence** is when both Osis and Lira are new on the same night.  The nights of a Low Confluence are very dark, and are said to be a time when the uneasy spirits of the dead walk the earth.
- An **Opposed Confluence** is when one is full and the other is new.

## Distance

Distances in the Zephyrlands are measured in wheels: 1 wheel is defined as the distance a horse-drawn wagon can travel in a day, and is roughly 24 Earth miles. From north to south, the Zephyrlands measure about 45 wheels (about 900 miles), and 40 from the Sinarin Ocean to the Sunbloom Mountains (about 800 miles).

## Magic

Magic was unknown in the Zephyran Empire, except in the myths and legends sung of by the bards, but when the Great Dragons came from the east, magic followed.  This magic has begun to seep into the lands, and, slowly, creatures are starting to learn to harness it through sheer force of will.  Zephyrans know where this power comes from, though, and not everyone thinks it's a good thing.  Uncareful or unlucky sorcerers can easily find themselves on the wrong end of a lynch mob.

The Great Dragons also brought the worship of Bahamut and Tiamat, primordial spirits of Order and Freedom, manifested by the twin moons Osis and Lira.  There's no denying that these new gods are powerful, as their followers have been known to produce miracles: healing wounds, calling on the wrath of the moons to smite non-believers, even returning the newly dead to life.

A user of magic, whether granted by the gods or manipulated by a sorcerer, is bound to the moons in ways that are not fully understood: The powers of both the cleric and the sorcerer waxes and wanes with the cycles of the moons.

The bards also tell stories of spirits and beings of great power who are sometimes willing to invest some of their powers in a mortal in exchange for some horrible deed.

### Druids

The Zephyran Empire placed a great emphasis on nature and the cycle of the seasons.  Ceremonies celebrated the confluences of the moons, the changing of the seasons, and the planting and harvesting seasons.

Every Zephyran village had a caretaker that oversaw these ceremonies and ensured that the spirits of the land were appeased.  After the Great Golden Dragon took over, these caretakers were strongly de-emphasized, though not actually criminalized; as a result, they have fallen out of fashion, especially with the younger generations.

Despite this, the magic of the lands is still strong, and druids are still plentiful.  They tend to live in the woods, close enough to their charges to be helpful, but not close enough to run afoul of Imperial soldiers.

### Bards

The Eshen have a long tradition of producing bards and minstrels, who delight with stories and song.  These entertainers have been traveling the length and breadth of Enda for as long as there were places to travel to, and are always a welcome sight in any tavern, because they bring news and gossip as well as music and stories.

These bards have always used their music to create wondrous effects, to dazzle, delight, and enthrall, but the magic of song is different from the magic of harnessing the elements or closing wounds.

<!--

At some point, introduce the runic magic of the giants, and the tattooed sorcerer.

-->

```
```

### Magical Weapons and Artifacts

Legends of powerful weapons and wonderous artifacts abound, often named for the mythical hero that created them, owned them, or made them famous.  Many of the most famous tales the bards tell revolve around them, from Hew, the wooden greataxe of Magnus the Invincable, to Throatcutter, a dagger made from the spine of a demon -- and possessed by it.

## Races

There are a limited number of playable races.  These include *dragonborn*, *elves*, *goliaths*, and *humans*.  Dragonborn are not available to players at first, due to their history within the Empire.

The following statistics and fluff supplements what is in the Players Handbook.  If there are any contraditions, these rules take precedence.

### Common Features

Every race gets a similar set of available stat increases at character creation time: one +2 and two +1s. Each race has some limitations as to where these ASIs can go, and you can't put more than one racial ASI in the same ability score.

None of the playable races have darkvision.

All of the races are the right size to ride a warhorse, though dragonborn find riding horses to be demeaning and will only do it when forced.


#### Starting heights and weights

|Race|Base Height|Height Modifier|Base Weight|Weight Modifier|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Dragonborn|70"|+2d8|175|x (1d6)|
|Elf|46"|+2d8|80|x (1d4)|
|Goliath|70"|+2d10|200|x (1d6)|
|Human|58"|+2d10|110|x (2d4)|


#### Starting ages

Race       | Base | Modifier | Middle Age | Old | Venerable | Maximum Age
:------    | :--: | :------: | :--------: | :-: | :-------: | :---: |
Dragonborn | 14   | +1d4     | 30         | 50  | 70        | +2d12

### Multi-racial Characters

Elves, goliaths, and humans can interbreed, but the resulting children are sterile and cannot themselves procreate.  Human genes are dominant over elvish and goliath genes, and goliath genes are dominant over elvish; a child will take after its dominant ancestor, and have hints of their secondary ancestor. Interbreeding is rare, and when it happens, it almost always involves a human; goliath/elf interbreeding is possible, but very rare.

Note this as a parenthetical. E.g.: "Human (Eshen, half goliath)", or "Goliath (half elf)".

#### Goliath Blood

A character with goliath blood inherits some of that parent's size, and must put one of their ASIs in either Strength or Constitution.  They are larger than their human parent, averaging mid-way between a human and goliath in height and weight (+6 on their initial Height Modifier roll). They also gain the Stone's Endurance feature.

#### Elvish Blood

A character with elvish blood inherits some of that parent's features: Slightly pointed ears, almond-shaped eyes, or a thin face.  They are also much more long-lived: They will be physically mature at the same time as the dominant parent (15 + 1d6 winters), but use the Elf row for the rest of their ages and for the Effects of Aging.

### Dragonborn

Dragonborn were unknown in the Zephyran Empire, and appeared in the land with the Great Dragons.  They are almost exclusively soldiers and officials of of the Aurelian Empire, and are unsuitable as PCs (at least at first).

Dragonborn are gray in color, with either greenish or silverish irridescent highlights that sparkle in the sun.  They are hairless, and their reptilian eyes tend to be yellow and black. They don't have a gender in the typical humanoid sense.

Dragonborn are trained from an early age to serve the Great Golden Dragon, so their background will generally suit their job: Soldier, Politican, Acolyte &ndash; or Criminal.

***Ability Score Increase.*** All dragonborn have the standard +2, +1, +1 ASIs.  One ASI must go into Strength, one in Intelligence, and the last can be put into any other score.

***Age.*** Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be up to about 90.

***Size.*** Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging 225 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base speed in 35.

***Bonus Proficiency.*** You are proficient in the Perception skill.

***Langauges.*** Dragonborn speak, read, and write Draconic and Zephyran.

### Elf


The elves of the Zephyrlands are a reclusive people, rarely leaving their traditional homelands.  Elves that do leave, however, tend to wander their whole lives.

***Ability Score Increase.*** All elves gain the standard +2, +1, +1 ASIs.  One of their ASIs must go into Dexterity, one of them is determined by subrace, and the remaining one can go into any ability except Strength.

***Age.*** Elves are the longest lived of all the races.  They reach adulthood in their late 20s and can live almost two centuries.

***Size.*** Elves average between 4 and 5 feet in height, and tend to be slight in frame.  Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base speed is 30.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Elvish. The forest and tundra dialects of the elven language are similar enough that an elf who speaks one can understand someone speaking the other, but they have different colloquialisms and local idioms.

***Bonus Proficiencies.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.

***Subraces.*** There are two elven subraces: *forest elves* and *tundra elves*.

#### Forest Elves

Forest elves originate in the deep, impenetrable forests in the northeast of the continent.  They have a peaceful relationship with their neighbors in Kylf.  They favor shortswords and shortbows in combat.

***Appearance.*** Forest elves have brown or greenish-brown skin, dark brown hair, and brown or green eyes.

***Ability Score Increase.*** One of your ASIs must go into Wisdom.

***Blessings of the Forest.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance against poison damage.

***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency in the shortbow and the shortsword.

***Bonus Language.*** In addition to Elvish, you can speak, read, and write Zephyran.

#### Tundra Elves

The tundra elves live deep in the Thundersnow Tundra, alongside the Vella.  Tundra elves use a long-handled shortsword called a *boartooth*, which is identical to a shortsword except that it has the versatile (1d8) property.  This weapon is considerd a monk weapon for tundra elf monks.

***Appearance.*** Tundra elves have pale skin; black, dark blue, or bluish-black hair; and light blue, light green, or light grey eyes.

***Ability Score Increase.*** One of your ASIs must go into Constitution.

***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency in the shortbow and the boartooth.

***Bonus Language.*** In addition to Elvish, you can speak Vellan (which has no written component).

### Goliath

Goliaths are massive humanoids, descended from giants, that originated in the Onoklot Hills.  They were renowned as metal smiths, making beautiful and useful objects out of tin, copper, silver, gold, and platinum.  When the Great Dragons came, the Onoklot hills were completely destroyed by the Great Golden Dragon and its draconic armies, reduced to the smoldering wasteland now known as the Soothills.  Because of this, many goliaths harbor a burning hatred of the dragonborn.

Goliath society was organized around excellence in craft and friendly competitions.  Fairness and honesty were highly valued, and their reputation for celebrations was legendary.  They blessed the world with beer, and are among the best chefs in the world.

***Ability Score Increase.*** All goliaths gain the standard +2, +1, +1 ASIs.  One ASI must go into Constitution, one in Strength, and the last can be put wherever the player chooses.

***Age.*** Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.

***Speed.*** Your base speed is 35.

\page

***Appearance.*** A goliath's skin is a mottled palette of greys.  They have black hair and black or dark blue eyes.  Both the males and females are bearded, and traditionally wear their hair and beards long and braided.

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Stone's Resilience.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

***Languages.*** Goliaths do not have their own language, instead speaking the same languages of around them.  You can speak, read, and write Zephyran.  A goliath raised by or around other goliaths will also speak Giant.  A goliath old enough to have lived in Esh before its destruction will also speak, read, and write Eshen (though not Vaneshen).


### Human

Humans are the dominant race in the Zephyrlands. Their appearances differ greatly depending on their nation of origin and culture.

***Ability Score Increase.*** All humans gain the standard +2, +1, +1 ASIs.  Each subrace has directives as to where some of these ASIs must go.

***Speed.*** Your base speed is 30.

***Human Ingenuity.*** You gain a free skill, tool, or language proficiency of your choice.

#### Eshen

The Eshen have caramel-colored skin, dark red ("the color of dried blood") or dark brown hair, and brown or black eyes.  They tend to have broad noses and square jaws, which, combined with their dark red hair, makes them a very distinctive-looking people. They prefer brightly-colored clothing, and take great care in personal hygiene and grooming.  They are master manscapers, especially the bards.

## Classes

Based on the cultural, racial, and magical makeup of Enda, some classes are restricted to specific races only, and some classes and many subclasses are simply not available, especially ones that make use of magic.

### Barbarian

Available to Vellan and tundra elves, and only Path of the Totem Warrior.

### Bard

The bards of the Eshen are known all over Enda, and can count on a free meal and place to stay, at least, if they offer to perform in a local tavern.  Bards are also the main source of news, rumors, and gossip, so their arrival in town is considered an event in and of itself, similar to a gleeman from Wheel of Time.

This class is only available to Eshen, and only the Colleges of Lore, Swords, and Valor.  Because it's based on music, a bard's magic is very different from other forms of arcane magic.

***Modifications.*** A bard creates magic using music, and does not need to expend material components when casting spells, unless the component has a cost or is the target or focus of the spell.

### Cleric

A humanoid or draconic cleric must choose Bahamut or Tiamat as their diety.  This choice constrains the available Divine Domains, and any domains not explicitly mentioned are not available.

Divine magic functions mostly identically to PHB, except for limits on spell availability.

Clerics are affected by the position of the moon that personifies their diety, but, unlike sorcerers, are unaffected by the complementary moon.

#### Bahamut

***Bahamut*** is the god of Order, Tradition, and Family, and the *Knowledge*, *Life*, *Light*, and *War* domains are available to its clerics.

When Osis is full, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1.

When Osis is new, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.

#### Tiamat

***Tiamat*** is the god of Freedom and Individuality, and the *Life*, *Trickery*, *Tempest*, and *War* domains are available to its clerics.

When Lira is full, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1.

When Lira is new, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.

### Druid

The druid class is available to all races. The Circles of the Land and Moon are the only available subclasses.

Every Zephyran settlement, even the smallest village, has a druid.  Since the Age of the Great Dragons began, the druids have been suppressed, but they still exist.  Dragonborn tend to stay away from them and leave them to their business, as long as they don't cause trouble.

Most NPC Zephyran druids are affiliated with a village or town, and are Circle of the Land.  They usually pick a small number of specific wild shapes and stick with them.  Since they don't get into combat much, the forms tend to be utility forms, like hawk, mastiff, or stag.

Not all druids are caretakers of a village or town, however. These "wild" druids can be either Land or Moon, and are not bound by any of the above restrictions.

A druid's powers are *not* affected by the confluences of the moons.

***Modifications.*** Land Druids' Natural Recovery feature changes to: *Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.*

### Fighter

The fighter class is available to all races.  The Battle Master, Champion, and Samurai subclasses are the only available martial archetypes.  Custom subclasses, like [Draconic Soldier](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rym_k9JC6z), are available as well.

Fighters are heavily affected by the Great Golden Dragon's restriction on owning armor and weapons.  Feats like Tavern Brawler and Grappler, and the Unarmored Defense fighting style, are common.

***Modifications.*** The samurai's Fighting Spirit feature is usable a number of times per short rest equal to your proficiency bonus.


### Monk

There are no monasteries or schools of martial arts on Enda, so a monk is differentiated from fighters by how they fight and what they focus on:  Mastering their life force (ki) and fighting unarmed. They are usually physically indistinguishable from fighters, and only their abilities at later levels and their armor/weapon choices makes it obvious they are different.  Available subclasses are Drunken Master, Kensei, and Open Hand.

### Paladin

Paladins are unavailable.


\page

### Ranger

Rangers are common in Enda, and are often indistinguishable from fighters.  Available subclasses are Beast Master and Hunter.

***Modifications.*** The ranger becomes a prepared spell class, instead of a known spells class.  Their slot progression does not change.  You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Rogue

Rogues are common, and the rogue class is available to all races.  Available archetypes are Inquisitive, Mastermind, Scout, Swashbuckler, and Thief.

***Modifications.*** Sneak attack requires a finesse weapon, and cannot be used with a ranged weapon.

### Sorcerer

Magic spontaneously arises in all races.  Sorcerous origins include:

- [Zephyran Mage](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Skw-NpQ0G) - picked up magic accidentally.
<!-- - [Eshen sorcerer](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rk3FJH5CM) - Trained by other Eshen sorcerers how to harness magic (Eshen only). -->
<!-- - [Child of the Moon](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SJZj1JPOym) - Blessed by Osis or Lira. -->
- [Draconic Blood](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/H10iykyxQ) - A descendant of one of the Great Dragons

A sorcerer's powers are affected by the confluences of the moons.  When both Osis and Lira are aligned during a High Confluence, Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1. When both Osis and Lira are aligned during a Low Confluence, Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.

***Modifications.*** Sorcerers are proficient with light armor and simple weapons.  Hit dice become d8 instead of d6.  Sorcery points recover on a short rest.  These are encoded into the origins.


### Wizards

Because there are no schools of magic, and magic has begun arising spontaneously, there are no professional magic users.

### Warlock

Available to all races.  There must be a story reason for all warlock pacts, and all patrons other than Spirits of the Land will be highly participatory.

Patron options at first level:

- [Spirits of the Land](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Bym2ppoaM), though there are lots of options there.
- [Heroic Spirit](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ryWP-L90G) - The spirit is a particular hero of legend, perhaps even Magnus himself.


The Hexblade patron will only be available if a sentient weapon is found.  All of the Hexblade's features would then only work with that weapon.  This means, in practice, that no one can start as a Hexblade, and it will only be a multiclass option.

<!--

One of the Great Dragons could also be a good patron later on, once they've been established story-wise.

-->

### Multiclassing

Multiclassing should be mostly easy and based on story reasons.  The exception to this is the warlock class; this should only be available if the character meets a potential patron along the way.

### Starting Equipment

Armaments of war are outlawed, per Edict of the Great Golden Dragon, but many families have armor and weapons that pre-date the Aurelian Empire.  Each class's starting equipment includes appropriate armor and weapons; we can assume that these are family heirlooms, handed down from the Zephyran days.  Any equipment that appears on those lists that doesn't exist in this world (like crossbows) can be replaced with another similar item (e.g., a shortbow).

### Starting Money

In addition to starting equipment, many characters start with a reserve of gilders based on their background, in any denominations the player chooses.

\page

## House Rules

### Miscellaneous

- For every Int modifier you have above 0 you can learn an extra language or gain proficiency in an Int-based skill.
- Going unconscious in combat adds a level of exhaustion.
- Don't roll until you explicitly state what you are doing and check for confirmation (unless I tell you to roll without further explanation).  A roll I don't ask for doesn't count.
- Drinking a potion is a bonus action, feeding a potion to someone else is a standard action.


### Rests

We will use a variation on the the gritty realism rules:
- A ***breather*** is a 15 minute uninterrupted period of downtime, and you can choose to expend a single hit die.
- A ***short rest*** is 8 hours, with no more than a 10 minute interruption.
- A ***long rest*** is 7 days of uninterrupted downtime in a safe place, where safe means there is no chance of random encounters.

#### Short rest changes

- After a short rest, you can choose to spend any number of hit dice to recover hit points, as normal.
- If you do not spend hit dice to recover hit points after a short rest, you instead regain spent hit dice equal to your proficiency bonus.
- You regain all spent hit dice after every long rest.
- A short rest removes one level of exhaustion.
- The land druid's natural recovery feature is reworded similarly to the wizard's arcane recovery feature: *Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.*
- Sorcerers' sorcery points refresh after a short rest, not after a long rest.


### Changes to Existing Feats

- All feats that give -5/+10 are modified thusly:
  - When targetting a creature with an attack using the weapon type appropriate to the feat, you can use your bonus action to focus your attention on that creature.  If that weapon attack hits, you may add your proficiency bonus to the damage dealt by that attack.
- Martial Adept provides 2 superiority dice, instead of 1. If you already have superiority dice, the bonus dice are the same shape as the ones you already have.

### Changes to spells

- Targets of the *friends* and *charm person* spells get a Wisdom save to see if they're hostile when the spell ends: hostile on pass, unaware on fail.
- *Goodberry* produces 1 berry per spell slot level used.
- *Mage armor* gives AC 12 + spell slot level (e.g., 4th level slot = AC 16).
- *Shield* gives AC bonus of +4, +1 per slot level (e.g., 3rd level slot = +7).

### Technology Level

- No crossbows.
- No firearms.
- No explosives.

### Effects of the Moons on Magic

#### Arcane Magic

The strength of your magic waxes and wanes with the cycles of the moons.

- When both Osis and Lira are aligned during a High Confluence, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1.
- When both Osis and Lira are aligned during a Low Confluence, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.

#### Divine Magic

Clerics of Bahamut and Tiamat are affected by the position of the moon that personifies their diety, but, unlike sorcerers, are unaffected by the complementary moon.

##### Clerics of Bahamut

- When Osis is full, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1.
- When Osis is new, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.

##### Clerics of Tiamat

- When Lira is full, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both increase by 1.
- When Lira is new, your Spell Attack Bonus and Spell Save DC both decrease by 1.



### Optional rules to consider

- [Starting Average](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/r1Fs-AibkX)
- No talking during combat unless it's your turn.
- [These encumberance rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8njggg/an_alternative_to_encumbrance_and_inventory_sheet/).
- ~~Healer's Kit Dependency: *A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer’s kit to bandage and treat the character’s wounds.*~~
- [Use Evasion rolls instead of Armor Class](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1WnH50GxQ).
- *I give players a free skill proficiency on 4th/8th/12/16th and 19th level. This is because there's no way in 5E for players to get skills beyond training for 100's of days which isn't always actually practical in-game.* ([via](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8oie6g/what_are_your_house_rules/e03sty8/))
