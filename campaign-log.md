# Session 1

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-18
- **Party Level:** 1
- **Date:** The 8th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Setting:** We begin in Squamusport, in the Riddling Fiddle, on Toplevel.  An Eshen bard is setting up to play in the corner, and the party finds themselves seated together.  After the party introduces themselves,  the bard starts to play.
- **Notes:** Much of this session will likely be spent introducing the characters and getting them all on the same page.


## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-18
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Rob (Silver Eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Chris (Val)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Lots of good RP as the characters introduced themselves.
  - Started with Dav picking a fight with Val: A punch to the face (*critical hit!*) established the tone of their relationship immediately.
  - Sort of continued the trend of elven girls liking Rob's characters (large-breasted server, in this case).
- When Cyrus showed up, they immediately headed out to see if they could help.
- Found the dragonborn soldiers fighting the bandits, arrived in time to help.
  - Silver-eye went down from a critical hit, but stabilized at the end of the combat.
  - The party did pretty well against the bandits.
  - Captured one of the bandits, who the remaining dragonborn soldier carted off to Squamusport.  They questioned the bandit enough to find out approximately where their camp was.
  - Cloaken found 342 gilders in the bandit camp, in varying denominations.
    - Also found a fancy leather jerkin, black and embossed with lions.  Cloaken kept it.  Magical power: When attuned, the wearer has advantage on Stealth checks in dark and dimly lit areas.
  - Dav found 75 gilders in a pouch in the overturned Coppertongue cart.
- They sneaked to the camp, and set up an ambush for the remaining bandits
- Rescued Felicia without much problem; she was terrified of Val, and liked Silver-eye (continuing trend).
- Cloaken kept the fancy jerkin.
- Everyone gained level 2 at the end of the session.
- Tracking XP sucks.  Vetoed.

# Session 2

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-23
- **Party Level:** 2
- **Date:** The 9th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** Session begins in the Riddling Fiddle, in the morning.  The party has all met up and has distributed the gilders they found in the previous adventure.
- **Notes:** A friend of Aldan's might be present for the session, as a guest player, and possibly for the long term as well.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-23
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Chris (Val)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Party left town with the caravan on the evening of the 9th.

### First night (9th of Peaksummer)

- They met the 4 other guards: 2 humans and 2 elves, all of whom know each other:
  - Human male fighter
  - Human male sorcerer (orcish runes)
  - Elven male fighter
  - Elven female rogue (very paranoid, very grumpy)
- Dav noticed that they were looking at some kind of printed card or something, which they hastily hid when he approached.
  - Aldan thinks this is something sinister, but it was intended to simply be a painting of a naked woman (i.e., porn) that they were gawking over.
- First night, Dav got into a good-natured scuffle with the human male fighter, and the group won 97 gilders by betting on the outcome.
  - Dav got in a good hit then grappled him prone, thus winning the bets.
  - Val and the elven male tried to outdrink each other and ended up falling asleep forehead to forehead by the fire.

### Second day (10th of Peaksummer)

Both Cloaken and Quilyn noticed that the human sorcerer had large, colorful tattoos on his arms.  Neither recognized them, but when Quilyn mentioned it to the other 3 bards in the caravan, one of them (elderly woman) remembered something she had seen in her childhood in Esh: Visitors that had the same colorful tattoos. She didn't remember much more than that, though, because she was a child (in reality, it was s group of orcs visiting Esh to buy metal goods).

It started raining very heavily during the day, and continued until the following day

### Second night

Found the skeleton of a large goliath dressed in shiny brigandine, a shiny helmet, and carrying a shiny greataxe.
- The goliath was stabbed repeatedly in the face; no other visible wounds.
- Val took the greataxe.
- They took the brigandine, though no one mentioned the helmet.
- They buried the goliath's body.
- They found a glowing green stone on the goliath's body (*You add your proficiency bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated*), though no one has tried to identify it yet.

### Third day (11th of Peaksummer)

Left the North Road (they were traveling north, with the Coral River to their left) and turned east onto the White Forest Road.  The area on the North Road was mostly forested, but once they turned east it turned into grasslands, which made Silver-eye happy.

### Third night: wight attack!

- The elven female rogue heard something during her watch and went to investigate.
- At the end of her shift when she didn't return, the elven male went looking for her and found her being attacked by a wight.
- When the rest of the party converged, they saw a total of 4 wights coming from a copse of trees to the south.  The party, along with the 3 other guards, made quick work of the wights.
  - The human sorcerer attacked using a longsword; they don't know if they can trust the party so they didn't want to expose that he can use magic.

When they returned to the caravan, Marcus packed everyone up and the caravan left immediately and hurriedly.

___
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-30
- **Party Level:** 2
- **Date:** The 12th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** This session picks up early in the morning of the fourth day, immediately after the wight attack. Marcus has woken everyone up and gets them on the road as early as possible, before dawn.



## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-30
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)

### Fourth Day

- Picked up immediately after the fight (replayed a tiny bit of the last session).
- They told Marcus what happened, and Marcus immediately packed up the caravan and got them on the road.
- The party is worried about the undead attacking, and make plans to keep the caravan safe.  Cloaken and Quilyn lead the caravan, Dav hangs back, Val flanks to the north, and Silver-eye flanks to the south.
- They passed Orlane, decided not to visit it
  - When they were overtaken by the farmer from Orlane who was leaving his home, they asked him several questions.
    - Farmer's name is Steve and his mule was Albert (Alfred?)
    - Steve says Orlane is cursed: People disappear for a while, then reappear. When they reappear, they're different.  Sometimes people disappear and never return.
    - Steve's wife and daughter disappeared and were found killed, floating in the river
    - Steve is leaving Orlane and going to start a new life in Nelsa
  - Their conversation with Steve might have left them interested in going back

### Fourth Night

- Niamh doesn't take a watch, as she's recuperating.  Quilyn uses *song of rest*, which greatly helps Niamh heal during her sleep.
- Davry and Buckley discussed the undead that they fought.
- Cloaken and Romero take a watch, and Cloaken catches Romero using *smoke shape*, and Romero admits to being able to use magic.
  - Romero says he can't do much, just a few things.

### Fifth Day

- They are still worried about the undead attacking them, and they make plans to keep the caravan safe.
- They notice smoke to the south.  There collectively decide it's probably bandits, but elect not to investigate.
- When the horse injures itself, Silver-eye uses Animal Handling and a *cure wounds* spell to heal it, and the caravan loses no time.


### Fifth Night

- The party reaches the crossroads, and finds Steve's wagon.
  - No sign of Steve
  - Val does a Survival check and finds tracks
  - Tracks lead to a copse of trees not far from the road
- In the trees, they sneak and find 3 wights standing around something.
  - They formulate a plan, and attack.
    - The wights were standing around the acid-corroded body of Steve.
- Cloaken notices two other groups of 3 wights, also standing around
  - Second group, they attack more coherently.
    - The wights were standing around the body of Steve's mule, also being corroded by acid.
  - Third group is standing around something
    - Coordinated attack
    - Find a nest of gemstones: 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, and about a dozen inert stones
- The party is starting to figure out what the gems are for and what they do.

Ended the session at the end of the last combat with the wights, because my ride showed up.  The next session will start approximately here.

# Session 4

___
- **Session Date:** 2018-08-15
- **Party Level:** 2
- **Date:** The 14th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** The aftermath of the battle with the wights.

## Notes

- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)
- Picked up immediately after the last session: Everyone standing around, having just defeated the wights.
- They told Marcus that there were *events* but didn't specify what they were, so as to not cause panic.
- Caravan left as early as possible the next morning, and arrived at Nelsa in the early evening.
- At Nelsa, they ran minorly afoul of the checkpoint coming in
  - Val forgot to put away his axe, so was taken to a holding cell immediately inside the town.
  - While there, he met Vimak Copperdog, owner of the Copper Dog Brewery and the Copper Dog tavern.  Vimak was very drunk, so Val took his draconic token (he doesn't have one of his own).
  - Val escaped with minimal confrontation, though he left his axe in the holding cell.
- They were there for the Feast of Midsummer, and saw the weddings and baby namings
- They visited Crazy Bertram's, though they didn't talk to him much.
  - They bought some supplies for their scheme to steal Val's axe from the holding area
  - Bertram is an incredibly old elf, hunched over, thinning grey hair.
  - They haven't really tried to engage with him yet; when they do, he'll offer to sell them weapons in exchange for gold and silver.


### Developments

- Val conspired with a local youth to return Vimak's draconic token.
- Val and Cloaken are conspiring to get Val's axe back from the holding area.
- Quilyn cast *detect magic* and saw that the 3 stones they have are magical.  Also detected that Cloaken's fancy leather jerkin (*Nightsinger*) is magical, and Val's axe (*Peacekeeper*) is magical.
  - The properties of the stones are not yet determined.  Let the players roll once they figure out to attune to them.

- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** The 17th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Starting Point:** The morning of the 17th.  The 15th was the Feast of Midsummer and the Midsummer Festival, and they spent the 16th wandering the town a little.
- **Pre-game Business:** ~~Clarify what subclasses Cloaken, Dav, Quilyn, and Val took, and update the progression matrix.~~

## Notes

- Sesson began on the morning of the 17th of Peaksummer.  It was rainy and misty and visibility was poor.
- Silver-eye has been spending time with the goliaths of the town, learning more about their (his) culture.
- Marcus seems to have disappeared from the caravan. He was last seen on the evening of the 16th.  Eshen wandering off from the caravan when it's stopped outside a city or town is normal, but it's *not* normal for Marcus.  People are not yet concerned, however.
  - Dav, Quilyn, and Cloaken investigated the area around his wagon but found nothing.
- The bartender at the Misty Pony is named B. Tenda (aka BT).
- The Copper Dog is a more divey bar, basically a biker bar, that Quilyn is familiar with.
  - She found some information about the hin and learned that Crazy Bertram might know something
- They have not asked Bertram for weapons, though they've gotten him to open up a bit about the hin.
- They learned more about the hin:
  - Small, named child-sized humanoids, hairless and vicious
- Val talked to B. Tenda about getting an illegal draconic token (on the 18th)
  - Cost: 100 gilders
  - Name: *Valerie Eaglesong*
  - Will be ready on the 19th
- Farms to the east of the town:
  - The Jacksons, a red farm house
    - Ranchers
    - 12 kids aged 14 and under *[or was this the Brightwoods?]*
    - 1 older matron
    - 3 adult males
      - 1 of them saw the aftermath of the ambush at the Brightwood farm
  - The Brightwoods, further east but within sight of the Jackson farm.
    - 3 kids under 5 taken
    - 1 of the Jackson adult males saw the aftermath of the ambush
    - Ambush was on the night of the 12th.
- Cloaken visited the shrine (only 2-story building in the town)
  - Administrative offices
    - Head bureaucrat has a long, unpronounceable name, Cloaken decided to call him Bob
    - Has a distinctive scarring pattern on the back of the right side of his neck
    - Bob gave Cloaken a lost + found form to fill out, after asking him if he experienced loss of health or property from the hin raids (because Cloaken asked about them).


## Loose ends and plot hooks

- What happened to Marcus?
  - Captured by an organized crime syndicate in Nelsa called the *Brotherhood of Thunder*.
- Ambush at the Brightwood farm
  - Evidence of hin attack from the 12th.
- Getting Val's axe back
  - Anything they try will work
- Shrine of Bahamut / Tiamat
- Mentioned *attunement* to Chris and Joe.

# Session 6

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-09-11
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** Late in the evening of the 18th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** They just finished sharing a dinner with the Jackson family, who own a farm to the east of the town of Nelsa.  Nearby is the farm of the Brightwood family, who were targeted by the hin a week ago.  It starts raining after midnight but before the hin attack.


## Session Plan

### Hin attack

- The hin only attack late at night.
- The attack will come early in the morning, and will target the Brightwood farm to the east of town.
- Some time after midnight, it starts raining lightly.
- The party is still at the Jackson family's farm. They will be awakened by one of the Brightwood farmhands banging on the door.
- They can see the fires of the Brightwood farm from the Jackson farm.
- The party will be able to get to the Brightwood farm after 2 minutes of running.  They might need to take time to put on their armor.
- When they arrive, they'll find that all 5 children were taken.  Both the father (**Evan**) and mother (**Dana**) are injured; Evan is unconscious, making death saves, and Dana is barely holding on.  If the party doesn't step in, Dana will stabilize him.
- ***Keith's ranger will arrive as they do, leave it up to the party to RP how that interaction goes, but the intent is that he is also tracking the hin and will join them.***
- The hin can be tracked pretty easily: DC 10 (to heighten tension and make the party feel successful).
- The hin move quickly (speed 35), so they have both a head start and move faster than the party, despite carrying children with them.  The party will not catch up to them, but will reach the caves about 15m after the hin do.
- It will take 2 hours to track the hin to their caves, and they'll arrive just as the sun is rising.
- As the party gets close, they'll see a large fire, and will be given the opportunity to sneak up on the hin.

#### The Hin Valley

Draw the valley and place boulders, bushes, and trees from the widgets bag.  Also place a large fire pit in the center.

### Retrieve Val's axe

The guard shack is not guarded at night if they have no one in captivity, and they don't have anyone currently.

### Vimak's fate

At some point after they retrieve Val's axe, they will hear that Vimak Copperdog was thrown in jail again for breaking into the guard house to steal back an illegal axe the dragonborn took from him.  He swears he's innocent, but the dragonborn don't seem to believe him.

### Living Expenses

Remind everyone that they will need to pay living expenses while they stay in Nelsa.  They arrived on the evening before Midsummer (14th).
