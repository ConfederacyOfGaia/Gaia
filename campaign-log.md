# Session 1

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-18
- **Party Level:** 1
- **Date:** The 8th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Setting:** We begin in Squamusport, in the Riddling Fiddle, on Toplevel.  An Eshen bard is setting up to play in the corner, and the party finds themselves seated together.  After the party introduces themselves,  the bard starts to play.
- **Notes:** Much of this session will likely be spent introducing the characters and getting them all on the same page.


## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-18
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Rob (Silver Eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Chris (Val)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Lots of good RP as the characters introduced themselves.
  - Started with Dav picking a fight with Val: A punch to the face (*critical hit!*) established the tone of their relationship immediately.
  - Sort of continued the trend of elven girls liking Rob's characters (large-breasted server, in this case).
- When Cyrus showed up, they immediately headed out to see if they could help.
- Found the dragonborn soldiers fighting the bandits, arrived in time to help.
  - Silver-eye went down from a critical hit, but stabilized at the end of the combat.
  - The party did pretty well against the bandits.
  - Captured one of the bandits, who the remaining dragonborn soldier carted off to Squamusport.  They questioned the bandit enough to find out approximately where their camp was.
  - Cloaken found 342 gilders in the bandit camp, in varying denominations.
    - Also found a fancy leather jerkin, black and embossed with lions.  Cloaken kept it.  Magical power: When attuned, the wearer has advantage on Stealth checks in dark and dimly lit areas.
  - Dav found 75 gilders in a pouch in the overturned Coppertongue cart.
- They sneaked to the camp, and set up an ambush for the remaining bandits
- Rescued Felicia without much problem; she was terrified of Val, and liked Silver-eye (continuing trend).
- Cloaken kept the fancy jerkin.
- Everyone gained level 2 at the end of the session.
- Tracking XP sucks.  Vetoed.

# Session 2

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-23
- **Party Level:** 2
- **Date:** The 9th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** Session begins in the Riddling Fiddle, in the morning.  The party has all met up and has distributed the gilders they found in the previous adventure.
- **Notes:** A friend of Aldan's might be present for the session, as a guest player, and possibly for the long term as well.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-23
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Chris (Val)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Party left town with the caravan on the evening of the 9th.

### First night (9th of Peaksummer)

- They met the 4 other guards: 2 humans and 2 elves, all of whom know each other:
  - Human male fighter
  - Human male sorcerer (orcish runes)
  - Elven male fighter
  - Elven female rogue (very paranoid, very grumpy)
- Dav noticed that they were looking at some kind of printed card or something, which they hastily hid when he approached.
  - Aldan thinks this is something sinister, but it was intended to simply be a painting of a naked woman (i.e., porn) that they were gawking over.
- First night, Dav got into a good-natured scuffle with the human male fighter, and the group won 97 gilders by betting on the outcome.
  - Dav got in a good hit then grappled him prone, thus winning the bets.
  - Val and the elven male tried to outdrink each other and ended up falling asleep forehead to forehead by the fire.

### Second day (10th of Peaksummer)

Both Cloaken and Quilyn noticed that the human sorcerer had large, colorful tattoos on his arms.  Neither recognized them, but when Quilyn mentioned it to the other 3 bards in the caravan, one of them (elderly woman) remembered something she had seen in her childhood in Esh: Visitors that had the same colorful tattoos. She didn't remember much more than that, though, because she was a child (in reality, it was s group of orcs visiting Esh to buy metal goods).

It started raining very heavily during the day, and continued until the following day

### Second night

Found the skeleton of a large goliath dressed in shiny brigandine, a shiny helmet, and carrying a shiny greataxe.
- The goliath was stabbed repeatedly in the face; no other visible wounds.
- Val took the greataxe.
- They took the brigandine, though no one mentioned the helmet.
- They buried the goliath's body.
- They found a glowing green stone on the goliath's body (*You add your proficiency bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated*), though no one has tried to identify it yet.

### Third day (11th of Peaksummer)

Left the North Road (they were traveling north, with the Coral River to their left) and turned east onto the White Forest Road.  The area on the North Road was mostly forested, but once they turned east it turned into grasslands, which made Silver-eye happy.

### Third night: wight attack!

- The elven female rogue heard something during her watch and went to investigate.
- At the end of her shift when she didn't return, the elven male went looking for her and found her being attacked by a wight.
- When the rest of the party converged, they saw a total of 4 wights coming from a copse of trees to the south.  The party, along with the 3 other guards, made quick work of the wights.
  - The human sorcerer attacked using a longsword; they don't know if they can trust the party so they didn't want to expose that he can use magic.

When they returned to the caravan, Marcus packed everyone up and the caravan left immediately and hurriedly.

# Session 3

___
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-30
- **Party Level:** 2
- **Date:** The 12th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** This session picks up early in the morning of the fourth day, immediately after the wight attack. Marcus has woken everyone up and gets them on the road as early as possible, before dawn.



## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-30
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)

### Fourth Day

- Picked up immediately after the fight (replayed a tiny bit of the last session).
- They told Marcus what happened, and Marcus immediately packed up the caravan and got them on the road.
- The party is worried about the undead attacking, and make plans to keep the caravan safe.  Cloaken and Quilyn lead the caravan, Dav hangs back, Val flanks to the north, and Silver-eye flanks to the south.
- They passed Orlane, decided not to visit it
  - When they were overtaken by the farmer from Orlane who was leaving his home, they asked him several questions.
    - Farmer's name is Steve and his mule was Albert (Alfred?)
    - Steve says Orlane is cursed: People disappear for a while, then reappear. When they reappear, they're different.  Sometimes people disappear and never return.
    - Steve's wife and daughter disappeared and were found killed, floating in the river
    - Steve is leaving Orlane and going to start a new life in Nelsa
  - Their conversation with Steve might have left them interested in going back

### Fourth Night

- Niamh doesn't take a watch, as she's recuperating.  Quilyn uses *song of rest*, which greatly helps Niamh heal during her sleep.
- Davry and Buckley discussed the undead that they fought.
- Cloaken and Romero take a watch, and Cloaken catches Romero using *smoke shape*, and Romero admits to being able to use magic.
  - Romero says he can't do much, just a few things.

### Fifth Day

- They are still worried about the undead attacking them, and they make plans to keep the caravan safe.
- They notice smoke to the south.  There collectively decide it's probably bandits, but elect not to investigate.
- When the horse injures itself, Silver-eye uses Animal Handling and a *cure wounds* spell to heal it, and the caravan loses no time.


### Fifth Night

- The party reaches the crossroads, and finds Steve's wagon.
  - No sign of Steve
  - Val does a Survival check and finds tracks
  - Tracks lead to a copse of trees not far from the road
- In the trees, they sneak and find 3 wights standing around something.
  - They formulate a plan, and attack.
    - The wights were standing around the acid-corroded body of Steve.
- Cloaken notices two other groups of 3 wights, also standing around
  - Second group, they attack more coherently.
    - The wights were standing around the body of Steve's mule, also being corroded by acid.
  - Third group is standing around something
    - Coordinated attack
    - Find a nest of gemstones: 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, and about a dozen inert stones
- The party is starting to figure out what the gems are for and what they do.

Ended the session at the end of the last combat with the wights, because my ride showed up.  The next session will start approximately here.

# Session 4

___
- **Session Date:** 2018-08-15
- **Party Level:** 2
- **Date:** The 14th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** The aftermath of the battle with the wights.

## Notes

- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)
- Picked up immediately after the last session: Everyone standing around, having just defeated the wights.
- They told Marcus that there were *events* but didn't specify what they were, so as to not cause panic.
- Caravan left as early as possible the next morning, and arrived at Nelsa in the early evening.
- At Nelsa, they ran minorly afoul of the checkpoint coming in
  - Val forgot to put away his axe, so was taken to a holding cell immediately inside the town.
  - While there, he met Vimak Copperdog, owner of the Copper Dog Brewery and the Copper Dog tavern.  Vimak was very drunk, so Val took his draconic token (he doesn't have one of his own).
  - Val escaped with minimal confrontation, though he left his axe in the holding cell.
- They were there for the Feast of Midsummer, and saw the weddings and baby namings
- They visited Crazy Bertram's, though they didn't talk to him much.
  - They bought some supplies for their scheme to steal Val's axe from the holding area
  - Bertram is an incredibly old elf, hunched over, thinning grey hair.
  - They haven't really tried to engage with him yet; when they do, he'll offer to sell them weapons in exchange for gold and silver.


### Developments

- Val conspired with a local youth to return Vimak's draconic token.
- Val and Cloaken are conspiring to get Val's axe back from the holding area.
- Quilyn cast *detect magic* and saw that the 3 stones they have are magical.  Also detected that Cloaken's fancy leather jerkin (*Nightsinger*) is magical, and Val's axe (*Peacekeeper*) is magical.
  - The properties of the stones are not yet determined.  Let the players roll once they figure out to attune to them.

___
- **Session Date:** 2018-08-30
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** The 17th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Starting Point:** The morning of the 17th.  The 15th was the Feast of Midsummer and the Midsummer Festival, and they spent the 16th wandering the town a little.
- **Pre-game Business:** ~~Clarify what subclasses Cloaken, Dav, Quilyn, and Val took, and update the progression matrix.~~

## Notes

- Sesson began on the morning of the 17th of Peaksummer.  It was rainy and misty and visibility was poor.
- Silver-eye has been spending time with the goliaths of the town, learning more about their (his) culture.
- Marcus seems to have disappeared from the caravan. He was last seen on the evening of the 16th.  Eshen wandering off from the caravan when it's stopped outside a city or town is normal, but it's *not* normal for Marcus.  People are not yet concerned, however.
  - Dav, Quilyn, and Cloaken investigated the area around his wagon but found nothing.
- The bartender at the Misty Pony is named B. Tenda (aka BT).
- The Copper Dog is a more divey bar, basically a biker bar, that Quilyn is familiar with.
  - She found some information about the hin and learned that Crazy Bertram might know something
- They have not asked Bertram for weapons, though they've gotten him to open up a bit about the hin.
- They learned more about the hin:
  - Small, named child-sized humanoids, hairless and vicious
- Val talked to B. Tenda about getting an illegal draconic token (on the 18th)
  - Cost: 100 gilders
  - Name: *Valerie Eaglesong*
  - Will be ready on the 19th
- Farms to the east of the town:
  - The Jacksons, a red farm house
    - Ranchers
    - 12 kids aged 14 and under *[or was this the Brightwoods?]*
    - 1 older matron
    - 3 adult males
      - 1 of them saw the aftermath of the ambush at the Brightwood farm
  - The Brightwoods, further east but within sight of the Jackson farm.
    - 3 kids under 5 taken
    - 1 of the Jackson adult males saw the aftermath of the ambush
    - Ambush was on the night of the 12th.
- Cloaken visited the shrine (only 2-story building in the town)
  - Administrative offices
    - Head bureaucrat has a long, unpronounceable name, Cloaken decided to call him Bob
    - Has a distinctive scarring pattern on the back of the right side of his neck
    - Bob gave Cloaken a lost + found form to fill out, after asking him if he experienced loss of health or property from the hin raids (because Cloaken asked about them).


## Loose ends and plot hooks

- What happened to Marcus?
  - Captured by an organized crime syndicate in Nelsa called the *Brotherhood of Thunder*.
- Ambush at the Brightwood farm
  - Evidence of hin attack from the 12th.
- Getting Val's axe back
  - Anything they try will work
- Shrine of Bahamut / Tiamat
- Mentioned *attunement* to Chris and Joe.

# Session 6

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-09-25
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** Late in the evening of the 18th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** They just finished sharing a dinner with the Jackson family, who own a farm to the east of the town of Nelsa.  Nearby is the farm of the Brightwood family, who were targeted by the hin a week ago.  It starts raining after midnight but before the hin attack.


## Notes

- Started the session immediately-ish after dinner with the Jacksons
- Headed to the Brightwood farm and knocked
- Zeb answered the door, was suspicious of the party
  - Keith is playing Zeb as a deep-woods redneck
  - Has a giant badger named Gristle ("Gris")
- The Brightwoods had a child taken by the hin 5 nights in the past (Childa, aka "Child A", about 7 years old)
  - They have 5 other kids, all ages 5 and under
  - The mother (Dana) runs the household and was in charge
  - The father was a teary mess, unable to be effective, having a difficult time coping with the loss of their child
  - The Brightwood farm is very small on the inside, and is the farthest out from Nelsa proper
- They immediately started attempting to track the hin.  Unsuccessful at first, but Zeb used Gristle to help find the trail
  - They ended up finding it by walking toward the woods far to the east and researching
    - The woods were very dark and filled with very dense evergreen trees (built like bottle brushes)
- After several hours tracking the hin, they stumbled across the valley where the hin made their home.
  - They fought a number of hin (about 11), who they dispatched pretty handily.
    - Need to make them more formiddable
    - Good use of spells by Silver-eye: *entangle* and *produce flame*
    - Need to read up on how to make a beastmaster effective: Gris is hard to justify
    - Need to create a legendary bow for Zeb
  - A few of the hin were eating a charred, hin-sized corpse that had just been taken out of the fire when they arrived
    - They did not investigate the corpse; it will probably turn out to be Childa.
- They explored the caves on the ground level, but didn't find much
- They started to explore on of the caves on the upper level
  - Ran afoul of 2 cave fishers, which they managed to reduce to less than half hp, but not kill.
    - Both rolled a Wis save at 50% hp, on a fail they tried to escape (both failed and fled).
  - When we ended, both cave fishers had fled, but it was not really a victory for the party.
    - Val ended up going down during the fight, with 2 failed death saves.

## Observations

- The party is very melee-focused, with no strong ranged capabilities
  - Zeb is a ranged fighter, but was rolling poorly
  - All of them except Silver-eye were throwing daggers and hand axes
- Cloaken
  - Making very good use of swashbuckler's Rakinsh Audacity
  - Still using daggers
- Dav's battlemaster skills are very impressive, such a great class
  - Aldan is playing it well and making good use of his skills
  - Was using a whip in one hand and a torch in the other, or throwing a hand axe with a torch in the other hand.  Fairly effectively.
- Silver-eye is effective with *produce flame* and his Healer's kit.
  - Good use of other spells, too: *cure wounds*, *entangle*.
  - Hasn't used Wildshape at all.  Maybe the gemstone that encourage that will help.
- Val is still trying to find his groove. Need to get that axe into his hands soon.
  - Val chose the longbow as his ranged kensei weapon, but doesn't have one.  Need to get one in his hands.
- Zeb is still evolving.
  - Keith is characterizing him awesomely.
  - Hasn't done any melee fighting yet, but has a battle axe
  - Was rolling poorly with his longbow
    - Need to track arrows
  - Need to read up on and fully understand the rules around the companion beast.
  - Made Heartseeker for Zeb.


## TODO

- Print and laminate cards: Heartseeker, Amber, Emerald.

# Session 7

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-10-02
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** Early in the morning of the 19th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** They just finished an encounter with 2 cave fishers (neither was kiled, just defeated)

## Session Notes

- The session started with the party taking a short rest after the battle with the cave fishers.  This took the whole day, and they resumed their exploration on the following day (the 20th).
- The session played out more or less exactly as expected: They explored the the large cave of the hin.  The cave ended up having a few main sections:
  - The main area where they fought the cave fishers in session 6.
  - A downward sliding path, ending in a T intersection.
  - Down the right tunnel was a large circular room with a 15' tall statue of a winged dragon.  The dragon was on a small island, and the rest of the room was filled with water that was fed by a trickling waterfall.
    - The dragon statue had a word written in giant runes on it: ***Vrisodunth***.  There were folks to who could read giant but could not speak draconic, and folks who could speak draconic but not read giant; Silver-eye (can read giant runes) read the runes phonetically and Cloaken (who speaks draconic) did not recognize them as a draconic word, so they surmised that it was a proper noun of some sort.
    - The statue glowed very slightly.
    - Zeb had a chance to provide some lore based on what knows from his orcish uncle; Keith provided some of it, in a very characteristic way.
  - Down the left tunnel was a room with a pool of water.  They fought a (nerfed) alpha grick and a carrion crawler.  The grick was a cross betweeen a standard grick and an alpha grick; it had the AC and hp of the alpha but the attacks of the standard, because the alpha hits *hard* and some of the folks are squishy.
    - They found a bunch of loot, including some non-magical stuff that they cleaned up and will use, and including some golkd and silver.
- They attuned to some of the items that they had:
  - Cloaken attuned to *nightsinger*.
  - Dav tried to attune to a breastplate found in the grick's room, but, alas, it was not magical.
  - Zeb attuned to the opal, and mentioned it might be better for Val. 
  - Val was not interested in attuning to anything.
  - Did Silver-eye attune to anything?





\page

# Session 8

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-10-18
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** the 20th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Notes:** Annie won't be able to play this session, so there's no need to work Quilyn into the session, but she *will* be here for session 9, so the party needs to have returned to the Jacksons' farm by the end of this session.

## Session Prep

### Party's recollection of where they left off:

___
- **Joe** We just cleared out the old statue cave, decided to leave the cave spiders alone, and took a short rest and attuned to items
- **Joe** We are physically in the short rest cave contemplating our next move
- **Aldan** we were contemplating attuning to the statue
- **Keith** Also Annie may be joining us for the 18th session, so you might want to have a random method ready for her to show up somehow.


### Plans

- Start by drawing the map from last time, and distributing the trees.
- The party awakens to the sound of a new group of hin returning from a raid. They have prisoners.
  - There should be 15 hin; should be enough to be a challenge.
- The hin survey the carnage -- their defeated compatriots -- and start searching the area to find the perpetrators.
  -  The hin will sniff conspicuously, and look in ever-widening circles as they try to figure out where the perpetrators have gone.
  - The party has time to get in their armor and prepare an ambush or something similar.
- The hin will put the prisoners in one of the caves that the party has not yet explored. (In this cave they will also find Childa and Kidren, weakened and near death.)

```
```

## Session Notes

- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Keith (Zeb)
  - Chris (Val)
- The session followed the plan almost exactly.
- There were 14 hin, not 15, because we only had 14 minis.
- The combat was Deadly; everyone but Dav went down, including Gris.
  - They used the environment well, utilizing high ground effectively.
    - Val pushed a lot of them down the hill, into others.
  - Cloaken landed a few sneak attacks, but Joe rolled poorly often.
  - Really driving home the idea that this world can be deadly.
  - They missed having a healer with them.
- They short rested after the combat, and attuned to a few new gems.
- At the end of the session, the party has returned to the Jackson's farm, and are preparing to return to the city.
- Where did Quilyn and Silver-eye go?
- Really need to figure out a better way for Zeb to utilize Gris.
  - More playing and watching makes me think that this should work:
    - Zeb can use his action to have Gris take a full Attack action, including multi-attack.
    - Zeb can use his reaction to have Gris make a single Attack, not multi-attack (choose any of Gris' attacks).
    - If Gris is ordered to defend itself, he will hold the Attack action for when he is attacked and then counter attack.

# Session 9

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-10-25
- **Party Level:** 3
- **Date:** the 21st of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** The Jackson's farm.

## Session Prep

The party left the Jackson's farm on the evening of the 18th.  Session 9 starts late on the evening of the 21st.

### Outstanding things

- Val needs to get his axe back
- What happened to Silver-eye?
  - Unknown
- What happened to Quilyn?
  - The party assumed she went looking for Marcus


### Looking for Marcus

- Quilyn went back to the caravan to investigate Marcus' disappearance.  Since she grew up with the caravan, she has friends and family there, and spent the last few days investigating Marcus' disappearance.
  - Normally, disappearing Eshen is not a concern, but Marcus is an exception; as the leader of the caravan, he has never disappeared like this before.  He disappeared on the 17th, so it's been 4 days.
  - While the rest of the party was gone, a ransom note appeared, from ***The Brotherhood of Thunder***.  The note demands a ransom of 1,000 gilders for Marcus' safe return.
    - It is generally known that the Brotherhood of Thunder is an organized crime syndicate that specializes in moving platinum, gold, and silver between people willing to pay for it. They also deal in contraband weapons and armor.
  - The ransom note indicates that an Eshen should come alone to a ruined tower about half a day's ride to the west of Nelsa bearing the 1,000 gilders.  The deliverer should come alone at midnight on the 25th of Peaksummer.
  - This gives the party time to take a long rest and retrieve Val's axe.
- Silver-eye.... what?
