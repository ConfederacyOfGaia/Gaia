# Session 1

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-18
- **Party Level:** 1

## Prep

____
- **Date:** The 8th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Setting:** We begin in Squamishport, in the Riddling Fiddle, on Toplevel.  An Eshen bard is setting up to play in the corner, and the party finds themselves seated together.  After the party introduces themselves,  the bard starts to play.
- **Notes:** Much of this session will likely be spent introducing the characters and getting them all on the same page.

### Cyrus Coppertongue

Midway through the bard's performance, a man bursts through the door.  He is bleeding from wounds on his head and chest, and panting, as if he'd run a long way.  "Bandits!" He gasps. "Bandits attacked my carriage outside town, and they took my daughter!"

The dragonborn soldiers immediately charge off, presumably to help, and the man falls to the ground, panting.  Folks help him to the bar, and the story comes out:  He was traveling into the city from his farm, about half a day's journey up the North Road, and when he was almost within sight of the city, the bandits jupmed out of the woods, killed his horses, hit him with an axe, and took his daughter.  He didn't see which way they took her before he passed out, but when he came to consciousness there was no sign of them.

His name is ***Cyrus Coppertongue***, and his daughter's name is ***Felicia*** (8 years old).  He is human, his wife (who is back at the Coppertongue farm) is a forest elf, and Felicia is a half elf.

### Bandits!

If the party sets out immediately, and follows the man's directions, they will find the dragonborn losing a fight to 6 bandits.  Regardless of how the party reacts, the dragonborn soldiers will be killed by the bandits.  If the party is hidden, the bandits will not notice them, loot the soldiers' bodies, and then head into the woods.  If the party joins the fight, 2 of the soldiers will fall in the first round, and the bandits will be injured.

The bandit camp will contain several bandits.  If the party killed the bandits on the road, there will be fewer here.  If they did not, they will all be here, and some of those will be injured. (If the party is unharmed from the combat in the road, or did very well, add another 1-2 bandits.)  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  Their camp contains a chest containing a 342 gilders, along with enough dirty jerkins and poor-quality weapons (mostly wood axes and hand axes) to outfit a band of 8 humans, along with the produce from the Coppertongue wagon.

Felicia Coppertongue is tied up but unharmed in the camp.  

The Coppertongue family wagon lies smashed in the middle of the road, along with its dead horse.  The Coppertongue family are farmers, and the wagon contained produce (which the bandits took).

### Aftermath

When the party returns to the Fiddling Riddle with Felicia, Cyrus is overjoyed.  He has been drinking with the other folks in the bar, and is pretty drunk.  He can't afford to pay the party anything, as everything he had of value with him was taken/destroyed by the bandits, but he will tell them that they are always welcome on the Coppertongue farm.

No one asks what became of the dragonborn soldiers.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-18
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Rob (Silver Eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Chris (Val)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Lots of good RP as the characters introduced themselves.
  - Started with Dav picking a fight with Val: A punch to the face (critical hit) established the tone of their relationship immediately.
  - Sort of continued the trend of elven girls liking Rob's characters (large-breasted server, in this case).
- When Cyrus showed up, they immediately headed out to see if they could help.
- Found the dragonborn soldiers fighting the bandits, arrived in time to help.
  - Silver-eye went down from a critical hit, but stabilized at the end of the combat.
  - The party did pretty well against the bandits.
  - Captured one of the bandits, who the remaining dragonborn soldier carted off to Squamishport.  They questioned the bandit enough to find out approximately where their camp was.
  - Cloaken found 342 gilders in the bandit camp, in varying denominations.
    - Also found a fancy leather jerkin, black and embossed with lions.  Cloaken kept it.  Magical power: When attuned, the wearer has advantage on Stealth checks in dark and dimly lit areas.
  - Dav found 75 gilders in a pouch in the overturned Coppertongue cart.
- They sneaked to the camp, and set up an ambush for the remaining bandits
- Rescued Felicia without much problem; she was terrified of Val, and liked Silver-eye (continuing trend).
- Cloaken kept the fancy jerkin.
- Everyone gained level 2 at the end of the session.
- Tracking XP sucks.  Vetoed.

# Session 2

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-23
- **Party Level:** 2

## Prep

___
- **Date:** The 9th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** Session begins in the Riddling Fiddle, in the morning.  The party has all met up and has distributed the gilders they found in the previous adventure.
- **Notes:** A friend of Aldan's might be present for the session, as a guest player, and possibly for the long term as well.

### Trouble comes knocking

As they're sitting in the Riddling Fiddle in the morning, 6 dragonborn soldiers come in; 4 soldiers stand by the door, and 2 elite soldiers immediately go over the to bartender.  Have the party notice them -- they're the only ones in the inn, so it's easy.

- The dragonborn ask the bartender something.
- The bartender surreptitiously glances at the party, and then makes "I don't know" motions to the dragonborn, who then leave.
- After they leave, the bartender either calls the party over to the bar or approaches.
  - "Those fine gentlemen were looking for the folks who hunted down the bandits last night. Luckily for you, we all look the same to them."
  - "I don't think I need to tell you that the little stunt you pulled last night won't win you any points with the Empire, so I would recommend that you head out as quickly as you can.  Eventually they're going to find someone who's more interested in making a few gilders than in protecting the people who do the right thing."
  - "***I would recommend that you split town as quickly as possible.  There's an Eshen caravan in the eastern field that is supposed to be heading out in the next few days, so if I were you I would start there.***"

### Taking to the road

The Eshen caravan camped outside Squamishport are called ***the Moonies***.  They make their living traveling among the cities on the northwest of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  At each stop along the way, they spend a few weeks trading and teaching at the city or town.  They've been at Squamishport since the 5th of Newsummer (31 days ago), which is a long time for them, and they're itching to leave.

The bard form the Riddling Fiddle is a Moonie, and leaves with the caravan.

***Marcus Hazel*** is the leader of the Moonies.  Marcus is hiring caravan guards, and is getting desperate, as no one is stepping forward. (The last group of guards were slaughtered in an ambush by wights, though he will only admit to that with a successful Persuasion check.)

```
```

### Life on the Road with the Moonies

Being a caravan guard is actually pretty easy; because of its size, animals won't attack them, and travelers usually avoid them.  As the guards, the party will be required to stand watch throughout the night, though they can split it among themselves, and there will be a few other commoners from Squamishport that are also along as guards.

1. The first night on the road will pass without event.
1. On the second night of the trip, a group of travelers will approach them during first shift.  Introduce this like an encounter, but when the travelers come into the light, they turn out to be a group of merchants that got lost on their way to Squamishport.  The group will spend the night with the caravan, and then head in the opposite direction in the morning.
1. On the third day of the trip, they come to a crossroad: the Old North Road crosses the White Forest Road, which the follow heading east.  The third night is uneventul, but make faces like it was a close call.
1. The fourth night is uneventful.
1. On the fifth night, something similar to the second night will happen, except this time it will be a group of 3 wights (type I) in the middle of the second watch.  They will stumble into the caravan and immediately being attacking the humanoids they see.  The Moonies will avoid combat as much as possible, though they will defend themselves if they are specifically targeted.  This combat should be pretty easy, but play up the disgustingness of the wights.  Marcus will mention that wights very seldom wander, which means there is very likely a den close by, and a den means a concentration of magic.  He will immediately start getting the caravan ready to leave, and asks the party to seek out the rest of the wights.  See [fighting the wights](#fighting-the-wights).
1. The sixth night is uneventful.
1. Late afternoon on the seventh day, they reach the city of Nelsa.  The caravan sets up outside the city, and Marcus politely dismisses the party.  He does tell them that the caravan will be here for at least two weeks.

The session should end once the party arrives in the city of Nelsa.

\page

### Fighting the wights
The wights were attracted to a crumbling tower very close to where the caravan decided to stop for the night.  The crumbling tower was once very tall, but now doesn't reach above the tree line, which is why the Moonies didn't notice it.

If the party approaches stealthily, the wights' passive Perception is 7, so they will almost definitely succeed.

The party will notice the smell of decay and death not long before they see the ruins of the tower.

There are a number of wights in the tower equal to the 1 greater than the number of characters that seek it out.

Once the wights are defeated, there is a glowing pile of gemstones in the center of the tower. 3 of them will have abilities, and the others will simply be glowing.

If the party explores the area after defeating the wights, they will find a large number of bodies.  Some are human, some are alven, some are dragonborn... and some are another type of humanoid that they don't immediately recognize.  Val can make a DC 20 History check; if he succeeds, he will remember that orcs were present in some of the battles.

#### Arcane genstomes guarded by the wights

There are the following gemstones.  All glow faintly from within, but only 3 of them have magical powers.

1. 2 peridots (50 gilders each)
1. 1 ***sapphire*** -- Your movement speed, jump distance, and climbing speed increases by 10 feet.
1. 1 emerald (100 gilders)
1. 1 ***emerald*** -- You gain a +1 bonus on Dexterity saves.
1. 3 quartz (25 gilders each)
1. 1 ***diamond*** -- Once per long rest, you can use an action to regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level.
1. 1 diamond (150 gilders each)
