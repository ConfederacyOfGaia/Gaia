## Campaign Overview

### Exploring Squamusport and the Sea of Fallen Stars

The party starts in [Squamusport](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SyXj8KBem#squamusport), hanging around the city.  I need a triggering event to bring them together.  Ideas:

- An Eshen caravan has set up outside of town.  They put on shows every evening that attract lots of attention, and during the day they set up stalls and sell exotic trinkets.

# Session 1

## Prep

- Date: The 8th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- Much of this session will likely be spent introducing the characters and getting them all on the same page.
- We begin in Squamishport:

> It is the 8th day of the month of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
> 
> As another beautiful summer day comes to a close, you each find yourself sitting in ***The Riddling Fiddle***, a tavern on the Toplevel of Squamishport.  There is an Eshen caravan in town, and a bard from the caravan is currently setting up in the corner.  The townsfolk are getting impatient with drink and anticipation, and the bard is egging them on while he sets up.
>
> The Fiddling Riddle is a family-style tavern, with tables arranged in a ring around the central cooking are, and each of you finds yourself at a table with 3 other travelers you don't know.
>
> ***[Introduce yourselves]***

After the party introduces themself, the bard starts to play.  There are 3 dragonborn soldiers in the tavern, in case they're needed: 2 by the door, and 1 sitting by the bard.

### Call to action

We need a triggering event for the party's first adventure.  The [classic advice](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/31/gun-hand/) is, "When in doubt have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand."

Midway through the bard's performance, a man bursts through the door.  He is bleeding from wounds on his head and chest, and panting, as if he'd run a long way.  "Bandits!" He gasps. "Bandits attacked my carriage outside town, and they took my daughter!"

The dragonborn soldiers immediately charge off, presumably to help, and the man falls to the ground, panting.  Folks help him to the bar, and the story comes out:  He was traveling into the city from his farm, about half a day's journey up the North Road, and when he was almost within sight of the city, the bandits jupmed out of the woods, killed his horses, hit him with a club, and took his daughter.  He didn't see which way they took her before he passed out, but when he came to consciousness there was no sign of them.

His name is ***Cyrus Coppertongue***, and his daughter's name is ***Felicia*** (8 years old).  He is human, his wife (who is back at the Coppertongue farm) is a forest elf, and Felicia is a half elf.

If the party sets out immediately, and follows the man's directions, they will find the dragonborn losing a fight to 5 bandits.  Regardless of how the party reacts, the 2 dragonborn soldiers will be killed by the bandits.  If the party is hidden, the bandits will not notice them, loot the soldiers' bodies, and then head into the woods.  If the party joins the fight, the soldiers will both fall in the first round, and the bandits will be injured.

If the party does not engage with the bandits on the road, they'll find evidence of a battle on the road -- along with 2 dead dragonborn soldiers -- and a DC 10 Survival check will allow them to follow the remaining bandits to their camp.

The bandit camp will contain several bandits.  If the party killed the 5 bandits on the road, there will be 4 here.  If they did not, there will be 6 here, and 3 of those will be injured. (If the party is unharmed from the combat in the road, or did very well, add another 1-2 bandits.)  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  Their camp contains a chest containing a 154 gilders and 24 bits, along with enough jerkins and martial weapons (shortswords, hand axes, and short bows) to outfit a band of 12 humans, along with the produce from the Coppertongue wagon.

Felicia Coppertongue is tied up but unharmed in the camp.  Unfortunately, Cyrus, can't offer the party a reward because his wagon was destroyed by the bandits.

The Coppertongue family wagon lies smashed in the middle of the road, along with its dead horse.  The Coppertongue family are farmers, and the wagon contained produce (which the bandits took).

The dragonborn soldiers have their gold and black tabards, their glaives, and their longswords.  They carry no other belongings.
