# Session 1

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-18
- **Party Level:** 1


## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-18
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Rob (Silver Eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Chris (Val)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Lots of good RP as the characters introduced themselves.
  - Started with Dav picking a fight with Val: A punch to the face (critical hit) established the tone of their relationship immediately.
  - Sort of continued the trend of elven girls liking Rob's characters (large-breasted server, in this case).
- When Cyrus showed up, they immediately headed out to see if they could help.
- Found the dragonborn soldiers fighting the bandits, arrived in time to help.
  - Silver-eye went down from a critical hit, but stabilized at the end of the combat.
  - The party did pretty well against the bandits.
  - Captured one of the bandits, who the remaining dragonborn soldier carted off to Squamishport.  They questioned the bandit enough to find out approximately where their camp was.
  - Cloaken found 342 gilders in the bandit camp, in varying denominations.
    - Also found a fancy leather jerkin, black and embossed with lions.  Cloaken kept it.  Magical power: When attuned, the wearer has advantage on Stealth checks in dark and dimly lit areas.
  - Dav found 75 gilders in a pouch in the overturned Coppertongue cart.
- They sneaked to the camp, and set up an ambush for the remaining bandits
- Rescued Felicia without much problem; she was terrified of Val, and liked Silver-eye (continuing trend).
- Cloaken kept the fancy jerkin.
- Everyone gained level 2 at the end of the session.
- Tracking XP sucks.  Vetoed.

# Session 2

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-23
- **Party Level:** 2


## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-23
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Chris (Val)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Party left town with the caravan on the evening of the 9th.

### First night (9th of Peaksummer)

- They met the 4 other guards: 2 humans and 2 elves, all of whom know each other:
  - Human male fighter
  - Human male sorcerer (orcish runes)
  - Elven male fighter
  - Elven female rogue (very paranoid, very grumpy)
- Dav noticed that they were looking at some kind of printed card or something, which they hastily hid when he approached.
  - Aldan thinks this is something sinister, but it was intended to simply be a painting of a naked woman (i.e., porn) that they were gawking over.
- First night, Dav got into a good-natured scuffle with the human male fighter, and the group won 97 gilders by betting on the outcome.
  - Dav got in a good hit then grappled him prone, thus winning the bets.
  - Val and the elven male tried to outdrink each other and ended up falling asleep forehead to forehead by the fire.

### Second day (10th of Peaksummer)

Both Cloaken and Quilyn noticed that the human sorcerer had large, colorful tattoos on his arms.  Neither recognized them, but when Quilyn mentioned it to the other 3 bards in the caravan, one of them (elderly woman) remembered something she had seen in her childhood in Esh: Visitors that had the same colorful tattoos. She didn't remember much more than that, though, because she was a child (in reality, it was s group of orcs visiting Esh to buy metal goods).

It started raining very heavily during the day, and continued until the following day

### Second night

Found the skeleton of a large goliath dressed in shiny brigandine, a shiny helmet, and carrying a shiny greataxe.
- The goliath was stabbed repeatedly in the face; no other visible wounds.
- Val took the greataxe.
- They took the brigandine, though no one mentioned the helmet.
- They buried the goliath's body.
- They found a glowing green stone on the goliath's body (*You add your proficiency bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated*), though no one has tried to identify it yet.

### Third day (11th of Peaksummer)

Left the North Road (they were traveling north, with the Coral River to their left) and turned east onto the White Forest Road.  The area on the North Road was mostly forested, but once they turned east it turned into grasslands, which made Silver-eye happy.

### Third night: wight attack!

- The elven female rogue heard something during her watch and went to investigate.
- At the end of her shift when she didn't return, the elven male went looking for her and found her being attacked by a wight.
- When the rest of the party converged, they saw a total of 4 wights coming from a copse of trees to the south.  The party, along with the 3 other guards, made quick work of the wights.
  - The human sorcerer attacked using a longsword; they don't know if they can trust the party so they didn't want to expose that he can use magic.

When they returned to the caravan, Marcus packed everyone up and the caravan left immediately and hurriedly.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-30
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)

### Fourth Day

- Picked up immediately after the fight (replayed a tiny bit of the last session).
- They told Marcus what happened, and Marcus immediately packed up the caravan and got them on the road.
- The party is worried about the undead attacking, and make plans to keep the caravan safe.  Cloaken and Quilyn lead the caravan, Dav hangs back, Val flanks to the north, and Silver-eye flanks to the south.
- They passed Orlane, decided not to visit it
  - When they were overtaken by the farmer from Orlane who was leaving his home, they asked him several questions.
    - Farmer's name is Steve and his mule was Albert (Alfred?)
    - Steve says Orlane is cursed: People disappear for a while, then reappear. When they reappear, they're different.  Sometimes people disappear and never return.
    - Steve's wife and daughter disappeared and were found killed, floating in the river
    - Steve is leaving Orlane and going to start a new life in Nelsa
  - Their conversation with Steve might have left them interested in going back

### Fourth Night

- Niamh doesn't take a watch, as she's recuperating.  Quilyn uses *song of rest*, which greatly helps Niamh heal during her sleep.
- Davry and Buckley discussed the undead that they fought.
- Cloaken and Romero take a watch, and Cloaken catches Romero using *smoke shape*, and Romero admits to being able to use magic.
  - Romero says he can't do much, just a few things.

### Fifth Day

- They are still worried about the undead attacking them, and they make plans to keep the caravan safe.
- They notice smoke to the south.  There collectively decide it's probably bandits, but elect not to investigate.
- When the horse injures itself, Silver-eye uses Animal Handling and a *cure wounds* spell to heal it, and the caravan loses no time.


### Fifth Night

- The party reaches the crossroads, and finds Steve's wagon.
  - No sign of Steve
  - Val does a Survival check and finds tracks
  - Tracks lead to a copse of trees not far from the road
- In the trees, they sneak and find 3 wights standing around something.
  - They formulate a plan, and attack.
    - The wights were standing around the acid-corroded body of Steve.
- Cloaken notices two other groups of 3 wights, also standing around
  - Second group, they attack more coherently.
    - The wights were standing around the body of Steve's mule, also being corroded by acid.
  - Third group is standing around something
    - Coordinated attack
    - Find a nest of gemstones: 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, and about a dozen inert stones
- The party is starting to figure out what the gems are for and what they do.

Ended the session at the end of the last combat with the wights, because my ride showed up.  The next session will start approximately here.

# Session 4

___
- **Date:** 2018-08-15
- **Party Level:** 2


## Notes

- Session date: 2018-08-15
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)
- Picked up immediately after the last session: Everyone standing around, having just defeated the wights.
- They told Marcus that there were *events* but didn't specify what they were, so as to not cause panic.
- Caravan left as early as possible the next morning, and arrived at Nelsa in the early evening.
- At Nelsa, they ran minorly afoul of the checkpoint coming in
  - Val forgot to put away his axe, so was taken to a holding cell immediately inside the town.
  - While there, he met Vimak Copperdog, owner of the Copper Dog Brewery and the Copper Dog tavern.  Vimak was very drunk, so Val took his draconic token (he doesn't have one of his own).
  - Val escaped with minimal confrontation, though he left his axe in the holding cell.
- They were there for the Feast of Midsummer, and saw the weddings and baby namings
- They visited Crazy Bertram's, though they didn't talk to him much.
  - They bought some supplies for their scheme to steal Val's axe from the holding area
  - Bertram is an incredibly old elf, hunched over, thinning grey hair.
  - They haven't really tried to engage with him yet; when they do, he'll offer to sell them weapons in exchange for gold and silver.


### Developments

- Val and Cloaken are conspiring to get Val's axe back from the holding area
- Quilyn cast *detect magic* and saw that the 3 stones they have are magical.  Also detected that Cloaken's fancy leather jerkin (*Nightsinger*) is magical, and Val's axe (*Peacekeeper*) is magical.
  - The properties of the stones are not yet determined.  Let the players roll once they figure out to attune to them.
