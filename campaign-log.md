# Session 1: 2018-07-18 [1]

## Prep

***Date:*** The 8th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.

Much of this session will likely be spent introducing the characters and getting them all on the same page.

We begin in Squamishport, in the Riddling Fiddle, on Toplevel.  An Eshen bard is setting up to play in the corner, and the party finds themselves seated together.  After the party introduces themselves, the bard starts to play.

### Cyrus Coppertongue

Midway through the bard's performance, a man bursts through the door.  He is bleeding from wounds on his head and chest, and panting, as if he'd run a long way.  "Bandits!" He gasps. "Bandits attacked my carriage outside town, and they took my daughter!"

The dragonborn soldiers immediately charge off, presumably to help, and the man falls to the ground, panting.  Folks help him to the bar, and the story comes out:  He was traveling into the city from his farm, about half a day's journey up the North Road, and when he was almost within sight of the city, the bandits jupmed out of the woods, killed his horses, hit him with an axe, and took his daughter.  He didn't see which way they took her before he passed out, but when he came to consciousness there was no sign of them.

His name is ***Cyrus Coppertongue***, and his daughter's name is ***Felicia*** (8 years old).  He is human, his wife (who is back at the Coppertongue farm) is a forest elf, and Felicia is a half elf.

### Bandits!

If the party sets out immediately, and follows the man's directions, they will find the dragonborn losing a fight to 6 bandits.  Regardless of how the party reacts, the dragonborn soldiers will be killed by the bandits.  If the party is hidden, the bandits will not notice them, loot the soldiers' bodies, and then head into the woods.  If the party joins the fight, 2 of the soldiers will fall in the first round, and the bandits will be injured.

The bandit camp will contain several bandits.  If the party killed the bandits on the road, there will be fewer here.  If they did not, they will all be here, and some of those will be injured. (If the party is unharmed from the combat in the road, or did very well, add another 1-2 bandits.)  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  Their camp contains a chest containing a 342 gilders, along with enough dirty jerkins and poor-quality weapons (mostly wood axes and hand axes) to outfit a band of 8 humans, along with the produce from the Coppertongue wagon.

Felicia Coppertongue is tied up but unharmed in the camp.  

The Coppertongue family wagon lies smashed in the middle of the road, along with its dead horse.  The Coppertongue family are farmers, and the wagon contained produce (which the bandits took).

### Aftermath

When the party returns to the Fiddling Riddle with Felicia, Cyrus is overjoyed.  He has been drinking with the other folks in the bar, and is pretty drunk.  He can't afford to pay the party anything, as everything he had of value with him was taken/destroyed by the bandits, but he will tell them that they are always welcome on the Coppertongue farm.

No one asks what became of the dragonborn soldiers.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-18
- Location: Aldan's house
- Attendance (table order):
  - Rob (Silver Eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Chris (Val)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Lots of good RP as the characters introduced themselves.
  - Started with Dav picking a fight with Val: A punch to the face (critical hit) established their relationship immediately.
  - Sort of continued the trend of elven girls liking Rob's characters (large-breasted server, in this case).
- When Cyrus showed up, they immediately headed out to see if they could help.
- Found the dragonborn soldiers fighting the bandits, arrived in time to help.
  - Silver-eye went down from a critical hit, but stabilized at the end of the combat.
  - The party did pretty well against the bandits.
  - Captured one of the bandits, who the remaining dragonborn soldier carted off to Squamishport.  They questioned the bandit enough to find out approximately where their camp was.
  - Cloaken found 342 gilders in the bandit camp, in varying denominations.
    - Also found a fancy leather jerkin, black and embossed with lions.
  - Dav found 75 gilders in a pouch in the overturned Coppertongue cart.
- They sneaked to the camp, and set up an ambush for the remaining bandits
- Rescued Felicia without much problem; she was terrified of Val, and liked Silver-eye (continuing trend).
- Cloaken kept the fancy jerkin.
- Everyone gained level 2 at the end of the session.
- Tracking XP sucks.  Vetoed.
