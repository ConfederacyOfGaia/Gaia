# Session 1

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-18
- **Party Level:** 1

## Prep

____
- **Date:** The 8th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Setting:** We begin in Squamishport, in the Riddling Fiddle, on Toplevel.  An Eshen bard is setting up to play in the corner, and the party finds themselves seated together.  After the party introduces themselves,  the bard starts to play.
- **Notes:** Much of this session will likely be spent introducing the characters and getting them all on the same page.

### Cyrus Coppertongue

Midway through the bard's performance, a man bursts through the door.  He is bleeding from wounds on his head and chest, and panting, as if he'd run a long way.  "Bandits!" He gasps. "Bandits attacked my carriage outside town, and they took my daughter!"

The dragonborn soldiers immediately charge off, presumably to help, and the man falls to the ground, panting.  Folks help him to the bar, and the story comes out:  He was traveling into the city from his farm, about half a day's journey up the North Road, and when he was almost within sight of the city, the bandits jupmed out of the woods, killed his horses, hit him with an axe, and took his daughter.  He didn't see which way they took her before he passed out, but when he came to consciousness there was no sign of them.

His name is ***Cyrus Coppertongue***, and his daughter's name is ***Felicia*** (8 years old).  He is human, his wife (who is back at the Coppertongue farm) is a forest elf, and Felicia is a half elf.

### Bandits!

If the party sets out immediately, and follows the man's directions, they will find the dragonborn losing a fight to 6 bandits.  Regardless of how the party reacts, the dragonborn soldiers will be killed by the bandits.  If the party is hidden, the bandits will not notice them, loot the soldiers' bodies, and then head into the woods.  If the party joins the fight, 2 of the soldiers will fall in the first round, and the bandits will be injured.

The bandit camp will contain several bandits.  If the party killed the bandits on the road, there will be fewer here.  If they did not, they will all be here, and some of those will be injured. (If the party is unharmed from the combat in the road, or did very well, add another 1-2 bandits.)  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  Their camp contains a chest containing a 342 gilders, along with enough dirty jerkins and poor-quality weapons (mostly wood axes and hand axes) to outfit a band of 8 humans, along with the produce from the Coppertongue wagon.

Felicia Coppertongue is tied up but unharmed in the camp.  

The Coppertongue family wagon lies smashed in the middle of the road, along with its dead horse.  The Coppertongue family are farmers, and the wagon contained produce (which the bandits took).

### Aftermath

When the party returns to the Fiddling Riddle with Felicia, Cyrus is overjoyed.  He has been drinking with the other folks in the bar, and is pretty drunk.  He can't afford to pay the party anything, as everything he had of value with him was taken/destroyed by the bandits, but he will tell them that they are always welcome on the Coppertongue farm.

No one asks what became of the dragonborn soldiers.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-18
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Rob (Silver Eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Chris (Val)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Lots of good RP as the characters introduced themselves.
  - Started with Dav picking a fight with Val: A punch to the face (critical hit) established the tone of their relationship immediately.
  - Sort of continued the trend of elven girls liking Rob's characters (large-breasted server, in this case).
- When Cyrus showed up, they immediately headed out to see if they could help.
- Found the dragonborn soldiers fighting the bandits, arrived in time to help.
  - Silver-eye went down from a critical hit, but stabilized at the end of the combat.
  - The party did pretty well against the bandits.
  - Captured one of the bandits, who the remaining dragonborn soldier carted off to Squamishport.  They questioned the bandit enough to find out approximately where their camp was.
  - Cloaken found 342 gilders in the bandit camp, in varying denominations.
    - Also found a fancy leather jerkin, black and embossed with lions.  Cloaken kept it.  Magical power: When attuned, the wearer has advantage on Stealth checks in dark and dimly lit areas.
  - Dav found 75 gilders in a pouch in the overturned Coppertongue cart.
- They sneaked to the camp, and set up an ambush for the remaining bandits
- Rescued Felicia without much problem; she was terrified of Val, and liked Silver-eye (continuing trend).
- Cloaken kept the fancy jerkin.
- Everyone gained level 2 at the end of the session.
- Tracking XP sucks.  Vetoed.

# Session 2

____
- **Session Date:** 2018-07-23
- **Party Level:** 2

## Prep

___
- **Date:** The 9th of Peaksummer, in the 32nd year of the Reign of the Great Golden Dragon.
- **Starting Point:** Session begins in the Riddling Fiddle, in the morning.  The party has all met up and has distributed the gilders they found in the previous adventure.
- **Notes:** A friend of Aldan's might be present for the session, as a guest player, and possibly for the long term as well.

### Trouble comes knocking

As they're sitting in the Riddling Fiddle in the morning, 6 dragonborn soldiers come in; 4 soldiers stand by the door, and 2 elite soldiers immediately go over the to bartender.  Have the party notice them -- they're the only ones in the inn, so it's easy.

- The dragonborn ask the bartender something.
- The bartender surreptitiously glances at the party, and then makes "I don't know" motions to the dragonborn, who then leave.
- After they leave, the bartender either calls the party over to the bar or approaches: "Those fine gentlemen were looking for the folks who hunted down the bandits last night. Luckily for you, we all look the same to them. I don't think I need to tell you that the little stunt you pulled last night won't win you any points with the Empire, so I would recommend that you head out as quickly as you can.  Eventually they're going to find someone who's more interested in making a few gilders than in protecting the people who do the right thing. ***I would recommend that you split town as quickly as possible.  There's an Eshen caravan in the eastern field that is supposed to be heading out in the next few days, so if I were you I would start there.***"

### Taking to the road

The Eshen caravan camped outside Squamishport are called ***the Moonies***.  They make their living traveling among the cities on the northwest of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  At each stop along the way, they spend a few weeks trading and teaching at the city or town.  They've been at Squamishport since the 5th of Newsummer (31 days ago), which is a long time for them, and they're itching to leave.

The bard form the Riddling Fiddle is a Moonie, and leaves with the caravan.

***Marcus Hazel*** is the leader of the Moonies.  Marcus is hiring caravan guards, and is getting desperate, as no one is stepping forward. (The last group of guards were slaughtered in an ambush by wights, though he will only admit to that with a successful Persuasion check.)

```
```

### Life on the Road with the Moonies

Being a caravan guard is actually pretty easy; because of its size, animals won't attack them, and travelers usually avoid them.  As the guards, the party will be required to stand watch throughout the night, though they can split it among themselves, and there will be a few other guards that were picked up in Squamishport.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-23
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Chris (Val)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Joe (Cloaken)
- Party left town with the caravan on the evening of the 9th.

### First night (9th of Peaksummer)

- They met the 4 other guards: 2 humans and 2 elves, all of whom know each other:
  - Human male fighter
  - Human male sorcerer (orcish runes)
  - Elven male fighter
  - Elven female rogue (very paranoid, very grumpy)
- Dav noticed that they were looking at some kind of printed card or something, which they hastily hid when he approached.
  - Aldan thinks this is something sinister, but it was intended to simply be a painting of a naked woman (i.e., porn) that they were gawking over.
- First night, Dav got into a good-natured scuffle with the human male fighter, and the group won 97 gilders by betting on the outcome.
  - Dav got in a good hit then grappled him prone, thus winning the bets.
  - Val and the elven male tried to outdrink each other and ended up falling asleep forehead to forehead by the fire.

### Second day (10th of Peaksummer)

Both Cloaken and Quilyn noticed that the human sorcerer had large, colorful tattoos on his arms.  Neither recognized them, but when Quilyn mentioned it to the other 3 bards in the caravan, one of them (elderly woman) remembered something she had seen in her childhood in Esh: Visitors that had the same colorful tattoos. She didn't remember much more than that, though, because she was a child (in reality, it was s group of orcs visiting Esh to buy metal goods).

It started raining very heavily during the day, and continued until the following day

### Second night

Found the skeleton of a large goliath dressed in shiny brigandine, a shiny helmet, and carrying a shiny greataxe.
- The goliath was stabbed repeatedly in the face; no other visible wounds.
- Val took the greataxe.
- They took the brigandine, though no one mentioned the helmet.
- They buried the goliath's body.
- They found a glowing green stone on the goliath's body (*You add your proficiency bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated*), though no one has tried to identify it yet.

### Third day (11th of Peaksummer)

Left the North Road (they were traveling north, with the Coral River to their left) and turned east onto the White Forest Road.  The area on the North Road was mostly forested, but once they turned east it turned into grasslands, which made Silver-eye happy.

### Third night: wight attack!

- The elven female rogue heard something during her watch and went to investigate.
- At the end of her shift when she didn't return, the elven male went looking for her and found her being attacked by a wight.
- When the rest of the party converged, they saw a total of 4 wights coming from a copse of trees to the south.  The party, along with the 3 other guards, made quick work of the wights.
  - The human sorcerer attacked using a longsword; they don't know if they can trust the party so they didn't want to expose that he can use magic.

When they returned to the caravan, Marcus packed everyone up and the caravan left immediately and hurriedly.

# Session 3

___
- **Date:** 2018-07-30
- **Party Level:** 2


## Prep

### Starting Point

This session picks up early in the morning of the fourth day, immediately after the wight attack. Marcus has woken everyone up and gets them on the road as early as possible, before dawn.

### Fourth Day (12th of Peaksummer)

Niamh (the elven female) is still fairly injured, and will have difficulty keeping up.  Arris (the elven male) will stay with her, so they will both be lagging far behind.  They don't have horses.  This will provide a chance for the party to offer Quilyn's wagon for her to sleep in, where she will be able to get in a short rest.

A little before mid-day, in the distance to the north, the party will see signs of a settlement: a road turning north, and smoke rising to the sky.  This is the city of Orlane, and anyone on the caravan can identify it, including Quilyn and the other guards.

There is a large road sign here, with several signs on it

#### Signs

This sign points north:

1. Orlane

These signs points east:

1. Central Gaia
1. Whisperwood
1. Silver Falls
1. Sterling City
1. Mount Zephyra
1. Nelsa
1. Mazurek

These signs points west:

1. Squamishport
1. Scarletgard
1. Fourwinds

Later in the afternoon on the fourth day, the caravan will be overtaken and passed by a merchant in an overfull cart, moving very quickly.  If stopped, he will say that he is leaving his home and heading to Nelsa to start over after his family was killed in Orlane.  He will hint that strange things are going on, but won't say more, and will leave.

The caravan puts more miles behind it than usual on this day.

### Fourth Night

On the fourth night of the trip, a group of travelers will approach them during first shift.  Introduce this like an encounter, but when they come into the light, they turn out to be a group of travelers that ran out of supplies and don't want to starve.  The group will spend the night with the caravan, and then head in the opposite direction in the morning.

Buckley will take first watch, and will engage with whoever he is paired with.

"Are we going to take about what the fuck happened last night?  Have you ever seen anything like that before, those walking corpses?"

Niamh does not take a watch on this night; she is still recuperating.  If they make a thing about it, Arris will take 2 watches.

### Fifth Day (13th of Peaksummer)

More grasslands.

Not long after mid-day, Romero notices smoke rising over a ridge to the south, but, unlike the previous day, there's no road heading in that direction, and the guards and Quilyn can confirm there are no known settlements in that direction.  If they decide to investigate, it's a Bandit Camp.

In the afternoon, the caravan needs to make an unanticipated stop, as one of the wagon's horses injures itself on the road.  Marcus will decide to make camp earlier than usual, since the caravan made excellent time the day before.

### Fifth Night

The party reaches the crossroads: The White Forest Road butts up against the Great Zephyran road.

## Notes

- Session date: 2018-07-30
- Location: Aldan's house
- In attendance (table order):
  - Joe (Cloaken)
  - Rob (Silver-eye)
  - Aldan (Dav)
  - Annie (Quilyn)
  - Chris (Val)

### Fourth Day

- Picked up immediately after the fight (replayed a tiny bit of the last session).
- They told Marcus what happened, and Marcus immediately packed up the caravan and got them on the road.
- The party is worried about the undead attacking, and make plans to keep the caravan safe.  Cloaken and Quilyn lead the caravan, Dav hangs back, Val flanks to the north, and Silver-eye flanks to the south.
- They passed Orlane, decided not to visit it
  - When they were overtaken by the farmer from Orlane who was leaving his home, they asked him several questions.
    - Farmer's name is Steve and his mule was Albert (Alfred?)
    - Steve says Orlane is cursed: People disappear for a while, then reappear. When they reappear, they're different.  Sometimes people disappear and never return.
    - Steve's wife and daughter disappeared and were found killed, floating in the river
    - Steve is leaving Orlane and going to start a new life in Nelsa
  - Their conversation with Steve might have left them interested in going back

### Fourth Night

- Niamh doesn't take a watch, as she's recuperating.  Quilyn uses *song of rest*, which greatly helps Niamh heal during her sleep.
- Davry and Buckley discussed the undead that they fought.
- Cloaken and Romero take a watch, and Cloaken catches Romero using *smoke shape*, and Romero admits to being able to use magic.
  - Romero says he can't do much, just a few things.

### Fifth Day

- They are still worried about the undead attacking them, and they make plans to keep the caravan safe.
- They notice smoke to the south.  There collectively decide it's probably bandits, but elect not to investigate.
- When the horse injures itself, Silver-eye uses Animal Handling and a *cure wounds* spell to heal it, and the caravan loses no time.


### Fifth Night

- The party reaches the crossroads, and finds Steve's wagon.
  - No sign of Steve
  - Val does a Survival check and finds tracks
  - Tracks lead to a copse of trees not far from the road
- In the trees, they sneak and find 3 wights standing around something.
  - They formulate a plan, and attack.
    - The wights were standing around the acid-corroded body of Steve.
- Cloaken notices two other groups of 3 wights, also standing around
  - Second group, they attack more coherently.
    - The wights were standing around the body of Steve's mule, also being corroded by acid.
  - Third group is standing around something
    - Coordinated attack
    - Find a nest of gemstones: 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, and about a dozen inert stones
- The party is starting to figure out what the gems are for and what they do.

Ended the session at the end of the last combat with the wights, because my ride showed up.  The next session will start approximately here.

# Session 4

___
- **Date:** 2018-08-14
- **Party Level:** 2

## Prep

### Fifth Night (13th of Peaksummer)

The caravan will set up for the night by the crossroad.

The party just defeated 9 wights and accumulated 3 additional gemstones (1 green, 1 red, 1 blue), but the green gemstone they had dissolved.

After defeating the wights, you headed back to the caravan.  Marcus decides that the caravan is too weak to keep going, so the caravan stays where it is.  A few nervous Eshen stand guard with the party, but the night is uneventful and passes quietly.

### Sixth Day (14th of Peaksummer)

There is a large road sign, with several signs on it.

#### North

1. Central Gaia
1. Whisperwood
1. Silver Falls
1. Sterling City
1. Mount Zephyra

#### South

1. Nelsa
1. Mazurek

#### West

1. Orlane
1. Squamishport
1. Scarletgard
1. Fourwinds

Marcus rouses the caravan early, and plans to get to Nelsa before the evening.

This day is uneventful, and the party will arrive at Nelsa not long after dusk.  The caravan sets up camp right outside the town, and Marcus will aproach the party, thank them for their service, and let them know that the caravan plans to stay in Nelsa until the next High Confluence, which marks the beginning of the harvest season (Autumn). (This is about 3.5 weeks.)

### Seventh Day (15th of Peaksummer; Low Confluence; Feast of Midsummer)

This is the party's first day in Nelsa.

```
```

### Nelsa

***Welcome to Nelsa!***

Nelsa is a sleepy town, full of hard workers (mostly farmers and brewers).  The population is normally friendly and cheerful, but the current mood is dark, because of the attacks.

The party will immediately notice an increased dragonborn presence, constantly patrolling the borders of the town (which has no walls).  They will scrutinize everyone entering town, though only insofar as to check that they are humanoid.  If anyone asks, a soldier will tell them of the increased kobold raiding activity of the last few weeks, and tell them to stay in the town proper.

Additionally, the party arrives in Nelsa on the night before Midsummer Day, which is a Low Confluence.  The town is planning for their Midsummer festival and feast, though their spirits are somewhat damped by the attacks.  The central area of the town is decorated ***TODO: HOW?***.

On arriving in the town, Buckley will insist that the party come with them to the Misty Pony.  It is owned by his family, and he is greeted warmly when they arrive in the inn.

#### Feast of Midsummer

The Feast of Misdummer is normally a grand party, though the festivities are damped this year by the recent attacks.

Traditionally, Midsummer is when marriages are performed and when babies are named.  (Because this is when marriages are performed, babies tend to be born in the spring, and thus are ~3 months old when they're named.)

#### Friends Depart

Buckley, Romero, Arrin, and Niamh stay for the Midsummer Fstival, but continue to Mazurek the next day. Mazurek is to the south, on the Sea of Fallen Stars.  It is another 3 days of travel to get there.

Before they leave, the group will be sure to speak with the party.  They will touch on the following topics:

- Niamh will thank the party for their help rescuing her from the undead
- Either Buckley or Romero will recommend Crazy Bertram's as the place to go.  "It has not escaped our notice that you're not exactly working with a great set of weapons.  Bertram will be able to set you up with some real gear, although it will cost you."

#### Long Rest and Leveling up

This will be the first opportunity for a long rest since the party left Squamishport; Silver-eye and Quilyn have both expended several spell slots, and several folks have spend hit dice.

This is also the time when the party levels up to level 3.  Cloaken, Dav, Quilyn, and Val will each choose a subclass at this level, and Silver-eye will get access to 2nd level spells.

They have accumulated a lot of gilders during this time.  **Don't forget that living expenses are a thing -- a night at a decent inn, including room and board but not ale -- costs 2 gilders.**

The party will need to stay here long enough to complete a long rest (~7 days), which will end up costing them a total of 14 gilders each (70 gilders total).  This will hopefully impress upon them that, even though they've found quite a goodly amount of gilders, they'll need to be careful with how they get spent.

#### The Misty Pony

The Misty Pony is currently empty, becasue of the attacks, so the party will have no problem getting rooms.  Room and board costs 2 gilders per night, but ale is separate.





\page

### Kobold Attacks

Nelsa has been the victim of kobold raids, which started a few weeks ago.  The kobold come in the cover of darkness, every few days; they steal horses and produce from the outlying farms.  There have been 6 human and goliath deaths and many injuries, and several dozen dragonborn soldiers have been killed in action as well.  So far, the kobolds have not dared to approach the town proper.  The dragonborn soldiers have widened their patrols to include some of the closer farms, but they simply don't have the numbers to protect every farm.

The night before the party arrives, there was a particularly bad attack; several soldiers were killed, and the injured ones are being treated in the shrine.

The night the party arrives will be uneventful, as will the next 4 nights.  On the fifth night, the kobolds will set one of the farms on fire, which will be visible from the town.  The farm's owners will retreat to the town, unharmed, though obviously upset that their farm and livelihood has been destroyed.
