***Wight*** is a generic term used for an undead creature.  This version is a very low-level version of it, but more powerful versions will exist, some with elemental powers as well. **Never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.**

The appearance of a wight is that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut, red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.

When a wight is injured by a slashing or piercing weapon, it's blood spews forth in the direction from which it was hit.  This blood is acidic, and caused 1d4 acid damage to any creature unfortunate enough to fail its Dexterity saving throw.  Directionality is determined as a three square area centered on the square from which the damage originated.
