***Draugr*** is a privisional term used for a generic undead creature.  This version is a very low-level version of it, but more powerful versions will exist, some with elemental powers as well.  **I need to make a more setting-neutral name for these creatures.** **Also, never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.**

The appearance of a draugr is that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut, red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.

More powerful draugr will have the ability to *enlarge* themselves at will. Enlarged draugr will have a separate stat block showcasing its increased abilities.
