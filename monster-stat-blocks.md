# NPCs

- Hagbard Celine, 12th level human (Eshen) bard (11/14/12/16/14/20). Leader of the Zoon.
  - Chubby, friendly, and outgoing -- like Santa Claus
- Bronson Harrange, human (Gaian) bartender.
  - Excellent memory for faces, terrible memory for names.
  - Remembers what people drank the last time he saw them.
  - Good at hooking people up with others looking for work/helpers/etc, but since he's bad at names, it always turns into: "Write your name on this piece of paper [slips over a random napkin scrap] and I'll get it to them."

## Sunless Citadel

These two orcish leaders are the leaders of a separatist group of orcs that found the Great Golden Dragon's oversight to be too oppressive, and decided to leave.  They brought a group of ~30 orcs with them (males, females, and young) to start a new tribe.  When the party finally visits the Sunless Citadel, they are in the process of deciding whether it's worth it to stay or return, and the party's arrival convinces them it's time to return.  Durnn tells the party that if they are ever in the vicinity of the Bowl of Fire, they should visit, and they can stay with him in his compound.

- Durnn, 6th level male orc sorcerer. Leader of the orc tribe in the Sunless Citadel.
- Grenl, 6th level female orc land druid.  Shaman of the orc tribe in the Sunless Citadel.

***Wight*** is a generic term used for an undead creature.  There are many different varieties of wights, but each shares approximately the same appearance and habits.  **Never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.**

The appearance of a wight is that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut, red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.

When a wight is injured by a slashing or piercing weapon, it's blood spews forth in the direction from which it was hit.  This blood is acidic, and caused 1d4 acid damage to any creature unfortunate enough to fail its Dexterity saving throw.  Directionality is determined as a three square area centered on the square from which the damage originated.

Wights are created by the magic of the Great Dragons seeping into the land, causing the dead to rise in a terrible form of undeath.  They are attracted to the same magic that created them, and will almost always be found around areas of high concentrations of magic, where they will make a nest.  They collect arcane-infused gemstones, so most gatherings of wights will contain 1d4 of them.

When determining saving throws, skills, and attack bonuses, a wight's proficiency bonus is the same as its type. E.g., a type III wight has a +3 bonus.

The type III wight is the same size as the type II wight, but has one of several additional different elemental attacks: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.  They are immune to elemental damage of their type, and some of them are vulnerable to elemental damage of another type (as noted per creature).

> ***Multiattack.*** The wight makes 2 claw attacks and 1 bite attack.
>
> ***Latch On and Feed.*** If the wight hits the same target with 1 or more claw attacks and 1 bite attack in the same round, as a Bonus Action it can attempt to grapple the target.  If this grapple succeeds, the target is knocked prone and the wight begins to feed on the target.  In successive rounds, until the target uses its Action to break free with a successful Acrobatics (Dexterity) or Atheletics (Strength) check, the wight can make a single bite attack against the grappled target with advantage.  A grappled creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the wight's Caustic Blood.
>
> ***Single-mindedness.*** Once a wight chooses a target, it will concentrate on that target, to the exclusion of all others, until that target is dead (or appears dead) or the wight is destroyed.
>
> ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the wight to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the wight drops to 1 hit point instead.  The wight has advantage on this saving throw during a Low Confluence, and disadvantage during a High Confluence.

A type IV wight is very aggressive, very strong, and very fast.  Compared to other wights, the type IV wight has grotesquely large fangs and claws. It comes in strong and fast and attempts to bite as well as claw its target.

A type V wight is Large, very aggressive, very strong, and very fast.  It is fearless and very aggressive.  Before attacking, it will choose the largest opponent, stand up to its full height, and spend the first round attempting to intimidate it.  It walks on all fours, like a silverback gorilla, so it might not be immediately obvious how large it is until it stands up.
