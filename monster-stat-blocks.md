***Wight*** is a generic term used for an undead creature.  There are many different varieties of wights, but each shares approximately the same appearance and habits.  **Never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.**

The appearance of a wight is that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut, red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.

When a wight is injured by a slashing or piercing weapon, it's blood spews forth in the direction from which it was hit.  This blood is acidic, and caused 1d4 acid damage to any creature unfortunate enough to fail its Dexterity saving throw.  Directionality is determined as a three square area centered on the square from which the damage originated.

Wights are created by the magic of the Great Dragons seeping into the land, causing the dead to rise in a terrible form of undeath.  They are attracted to the same magic that created them, and will almost always be found around areas of high concentrations of magic, where they will make a nest.  They collect arcane-infused gemstones, so most gatherings of wights will contain 1d4 of them.

The type III wight is the same size as the type II wight, but has one of several additional different elemental attacks: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.  They are immune to elemental damage of their type, and some of them are vulnerable to elemental damage of another type (as noted per creature).

A type V wight is Large, very aggressive, very strong, and very fast.  It is fearless and very aggressive.  Before attacking, it will choose the largest opponent, stand up to its full height, and spend the first round attempting to intimidate it.  It walks on all fours, like a silverback gorilla, so it might not be immediately obvious how large it is until it stands up.
