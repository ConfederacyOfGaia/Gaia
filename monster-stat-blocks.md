# NPCs


### Bronson Harrange

*Human (Gaian) bartender, Squamishport*

- Works at the first tavern or bar the party comes to in Squamishport.
- Excellent memory for faces, terrible memory for names.
- Remembers what people drank the last time he saw them.
- Good at hooking people up with others looking for work/helpers/etc, but since he's bad at names, it always turns into: "Write your name on this piece of paper [slips over a random napkin scrap] and I'll get it to them."

### Cyrus Coppertongue

*Human (Gaian) farmer*

Cyrus lives with his elven wife (*name?*) and 8yo daughter Felicia on a farm not too far from Squamishport.  In session 1, Felicia's kidnapping was the inciting incident that got the party together.


### Hagbard Celine

*12th level human (Eshen) bard (11/14/12/16/14/16). Leader of the Zoon.*

- Chubby, friendly, and outgoing.
- Looks and acts like Santa Claus.
- Is a shrewd businessman, and very difficult to fool.
- Skills: Deception +11, Insight +10, Persuasion +11

### Marcus Hazel

*11th level human (Eshen) rogue (12/20/14/16/11/15). Leader of the Moonies.*

- Good looking man with very long, straight, light brown hair, set in a braid down his back.
- Dressed entirely in teal, purple, and white.
- Smooth talker.
- Skills: Deception +10, Insight +4, Pursuasion +10
- Carries a rapier openly. [The dragonborn would never even consider entering an Eshen caravan, so he knows it's safe, but he likes to pretend he's flaunting the law.]

### Tom Foolery

*Human (Gaian) fence, Squamishport*

- Cloaken's contact in Squamishport.
- Willing to buy rare or magical items, for a price.
  - Can't afford to buy any arcane gemstones over level 1.
- Knows his History well, and specializes in knowledge about weapons of legend.  DC 15 chance that Tom can identify any named magical weapon or armor the party brings to him.
- Can Tom get them magical items?  Maybe common items

# Fellow Travelers

These travelers are guards on the Mooonies' caravan with the party.  They are a little more powerful than the party (3rd level).  Because they have two casters, they are very hesitant to show their true abilities.

The purpose of this group is multifold: To provide interesting NPCs, to provide a counter point to the party, as a storytelling device to introduce new things: Sorcerers, orcs, sea elves.

***Wight*** is a generic term used for an undead creature.  There are many different varieties of wights, but each shares approximately the same appearance and habits.  **Never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.**

The appearance of a wight is that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut, red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.

When a wight is injured by a slashing or piercing weapon, it's blood spews forth in the direction from which it was hit.  This blood is acidic, and caused 1d4 acid damage to any creature unfortunate enough to fail its Dexterity saving throw.  Directionality is determined as a three square area centered on the square from which the damage originated.

Wights are created by the magic of the Great Dragons seeping into the land, causing the dead to rise in a terrible form of undeath.  They are attracted to the same magic that created them, and will almost always be found around areas of high concentrations of magic, where they will make a nest.  They collect arcane-infused gemstones, so most gatherings of wights will contain 1d4 of them.

When determining saving throws, skills, and attack bonuses, a wight's proficiency bonus is the same as its type. E.g., a type III wight has a +3 bonus.

The type III wight is the same size as the type II wight, but has one of several additional different elemental attacks: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.  They are immune to elemental damage of their type, and some of them are vulnerable to elemental damage of another type (as noted per creature).

A type IV wight is very aggressive, very strong, and very fast.  Compared to other wights, the type IV wight has grotesquely large fangs and claws. It comes in strong and fast and attempts to bite as well as claw its target.

A type V wight is Large, very aggressive, very strong, and very fast.  It is fearless and very aggressive.  Before attacking, it will choose the largest opponent, stand up to its full height, and spend the first round attempting to intimidate it.  It walks on all fours, like a silverback gorilla, so it might not be immediately obvious how large it is until it stands up.
