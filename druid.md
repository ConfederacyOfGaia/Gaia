# Druid

Druids devote their lives to studying the natural world. They are attuned to nature, and, in return, they draw magical power from it.  Most druids discover their powers by accident, rather than through training, but all of them learn to control the elements, the plants and beasts of the forests, hills, plains, and mountains, and the very essence of life itself.

At every level, a druid adds their Wisdom bonus to their number of spell points.  Thus, a 14th level druid with a Wisdom of 16 (+3) would have an additional 42 points (14 x 3), for a total of 145 points.

## Commune With Nature

This ability is identical to the Commune With Nature Feat.

**TODO:** Need to create a ~3rd level spell that permanently enchants an item, for use when creating magic items.
Certain circles get unarmed fighting abilities based on their animal: Bear, Dragon, others?

## Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast Spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three Cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

## Gaian Affinity

Druids are deeply attuned to their land in which they live.  The different lands of Gaia "feel" different, so a druid naturally gains an affinity to their native region of the continent.  These regions are the West, the East, the North, and the Center of the continent.  A druid who is not in their native lands is hampered by the unfamiliarity of their environment.  If you are not in your native land, your available spell points are temporarily reduced by 10%, and it takes an extra hour of communing with nature to regain your points.  Furthermore, if a druid from the West is in the East, or a Druid from the East is in the West, the extreme unfamiliarity reduces available points by 20% and requires two extra hours of Communing With Nature to regain spell points.

## Magic Sense

Starting at 2nd level, a druid can tell by looking at something if it's enchanted with nature (but not arcane) magic.  At 5th level, this ability improves so that they can also identify items enchanted with arcane magic.

## Creating magical potions and salves

At 3rd level, a druid learns how to make potions and salves.  The process is detailed in [the magic page](magic.md).
