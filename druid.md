# Druid

Druids devote their lives to studying the natural world. They are attuned to nature, and, in return, they draw magical power from it.  Most druids discover their powers by accident, rather than through training, but all of them learn to control the elements, the plants and beasts of the forests, hills, plains, and mountains, and the very essence of life itself.

**Note:** In the Harry Potter world, a druid is called an animagus.  Play with that a bit...

Every time you gain a level, you roll for new spell points, much like you roll for new hit points: You get 1d4+4 spell points per level, + your Wisdom modifier.  Thus, a 14th level druid with a Wisdom of 16 (+3) would have from 115 to 154 spell points.

### Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast Spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and below for the druid spell list.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four Cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

*This whole section is out of date!  Adjust with info on spell points*

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. 

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style='text-align:center'>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, "Equipment") as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Magic Sense

Starting at 2nd level, a druid can tell by looking at something if it's enchanted with nature (but not arcane) magic.  At 5th level, this ability improves so that they can also identify items enchanted with arcane magic.

### Totem Animal

*Use the [Circle of the Bear](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuMtiayU2p2bm9xNkJkMVhJSjg/view) as a prototype for these abilities*

Starting at 2nd level, the DM will choose for you an animal with which you identify strongly; this animal becomes your *Totem Animal*, and is the focus of most of your special abilities for the rest of your career.  Your totem animal will be a non-magical beast of the same size as your character with a CR of 1/2 or less.  As your gain druid levels, you will gain more of the abilties of your totem animal, including the ability to shapechange into your animal.

As a result of this affinity, at 2nd level you gain a permanent *speak with animals* effect for your animal type.  Animals of your type will consider you a friend, and never attack you or your companions, unless attacked first.

\page

### Wild Shape

Once you gain your totem animal at 2nd level, you gain the ability to shapechange into this animal as an action.  You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* When you are in your wild form, you gain the appearance, size speed, feats, and abilities of your totem animal, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.  You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.  If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.  Your wild shape becomes stronger as you gain levels, according to the tables provided below.
* When you transform, you assume the hit points and Hit Dice according to the table below. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Creating magical potions and salves

At 3rd level, you automatically get the Botanist Feat, enabling you to make potions and salves.

### Wild Skill Improvement

At 3rd level, you may gain proficiency in one of the skills listed below.  When your animal form increases in level, you may choose another skill from the list below.  If you already have proficiency in the skill, you may instead add your proficiency bonus twice.

* Animal Handling
* Atheletics
* Perception
* Survival

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Wild Shape Improvement

At 6th, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape as a bonus action, rather than an action.  Some totem animals provide an advantage at 6th level, as noted in the animal descriptions. In addition, your Wild Shape improves in its physical ability scores, Hit Dice, hit points, and attack bonus.

At 10th level, your attunement with your totem animal starts to express itself even when you are not transformed: You gain +1 on the ability score associated with your totem animal.  Also at 10th level, your Wild Shape again improves in its physical ability scores, Hit Dice, hit points, and attack bonus.

At 14th level, your attunement with your totem animal continues to express itself even when you are not transformed, and you gain another feature of your totem animal even when you are not transformed.  Also at 14th lvel, your Wild Shape again improves in its physical ability scores, Hit Dice, hit points, and attack bonus.

### Beast Spells

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast your druid spells while in your Wild Shape.

### Timeless Body

Starting at 20th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.
