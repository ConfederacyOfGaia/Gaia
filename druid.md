# Druid

Druids devote their lives to studying the natural world. They are attuned to nature, and, in return, they draw magical power from it.  Most druids discover their powers by accident, rather than through training, but all of them learn to control the elements, the plants and beasts of the forests, hills, plains, and mountains, and the very essence of life itself.

**Note:** In the Harry Potter world, a druid is called an animagus.  Play with that a bit...

Every time you gain a level, you roll for new spell points, much like you roll for new hit points: You get 1d4+4 spell points per level, + your Wisdom modifier.  Thus, a 14th level druid with a Wisdom of 16 (+3) would have from 115 to 154 spell points.

### Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast Spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and below for the druid spell list.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four Cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

*This whole section is out of date!  Adjust with info on spell points*

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. 

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style='text-align:center'>

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom modifier

</div>

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Magic Sense

You can tell by looking at something if it's enchanted with nature (but not arcane) magic.  At 5th level, this ability improves so that they can also identify items enchanted with arcane magic.

### Natural Affinity

At 1st level, when becoming a druid, you develop a strong, mystical connection to the land.  Choose one of the following regions:  Coast, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Mountains, Swamp, or Tundra.  The land you choose should be the one in which you live, and it will determine what your totem animal is.

Your choice provides an additional spell lists from which you can select spells.  If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain of your chosen type costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

### Animal Connection

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to communicate with all the animals in your land via *telempathy*.  Telempathy lets you read and convey emotions and emotional states telepathically, including fear, hunger, and contentment.

### Totem Animal

*Use the [Circle of the Bear](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuMtiayU2p2bm9xNkJkMVhJSjg/view) as a prototype for these abilities*

Starting at 2nd level, working with the DM you will choose an animal with which you identify strongly, based on the affinity you chose at 1st level.  This animal becomes your *Totem Animal*, and is the focus of many of your special abilities for the rest of your career.  Your totem animal will be a non-magical beast of roughly the same size as your character.  As you gain druid levels, you will gain more of the abilties of your totem animal, including the ability to shapechange into your animal.

Because of your affinity with your totem animal, you start to subtly take on some of the characteristics of this animal.  Nothing overt, but people will sometimes be left with the vague feeling that you remind them of your animal, although they won't be able to put their finger on it exactly.  The exact changes are up to the DM, but might include things like:  your hair starts turning the color of your animal's typical hair coloration, or your nose elongates, or your speech patterns start to take on those of your animal, or you start sleeping very late during the winter.  These have no in-game effects, but should present you with a number of excellent role-playing opportunities.

Also as a result of this affinity, at 2nd level you gain a permanent *speak with animals* effect for your animal type.  Animals of your type will consider you a friend, and never attack you or your companions, unless attacked first.

### Wild Shape

Once you gain your totem animal at 2nd level, you gain the ability to shapechange into this animal as an action.  You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* When you are in your wild form, you gain the appearance, size speed, feats, and abilities of your totem animal, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.  You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.  If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.  Your wild shape becomes stronger as you gain levels, according to the tables provided below.
* When you transform, you assume the hit points and Hit Dice according to the table below. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Botanist

At 3rd level, you automatically get the Botanist Feat, enabling you to make potions and salves.

### Totem Animal Attunement

At 3rd level, you start to take on some of the abilities of your totem animal even when you are not transformed.  What these abilities are varies by animal, and is detailed in the section on animals, below.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Improved Botanist

At 6th level, you gain the Botanist II Feat, which improves your potion-creation abilities.

### Land's Stride

Starting at 6th level, your abilty to move through unhindred through nonmagical difficult terrain is expanded to natural terrain of all types, regardless of the region.

### Primal Equivalence

At 10th level, your attunement with your totem animal continues to express itself, but now it is more pronounced and has in-game effects: You gain +1 on the primary ability scores associated with your totem animal.  Unlike other ability score improvements, you may not replace this with a Feat.  Unlike normal ability score increases, an ability score *can* increase beyond 20 with this feature.

### Beast Spells

Beginning at 14th level, you can cast your druid spells while in your animal shape.

### Timeless Body

Starting at 20th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

## Animals

For each creature:

1. Figure out the baseline 2nd level stats, and then express them in terms of the proficiency bonus.  Each proficiency bonus will result in an increase in the animal's statistics.  The status should be adjusted so that it's about CR 1 at 8th level.
  * A creature levels up when the druid increases their proficiency bonus.  When this happens, the Str and Con of the animal form each increases by 1 point (for Small and Medium creatures) or 2 points (for Large creatures).  Dex doesn't change.
  * The process for calculating AC, HP, attack bonus, and damage is to start with the baseline stats and then increase them based on the increased Str, Dex, and Con that was calculated in the previous step.  The bonuses in the stat blocks are always based on these physical characteristics, so it is possible to do this reliably.
  * The tricky part is figuring out where to start each creature.  A giant badger, for example has a CR of 1/4, and our taget is for the creature to be CR 1 when the druid is 8th level.  That means that we need to scale up.  A brown bear, however, is CR 1 already, so we need to scale it down for 2nd and 5th level druids.
