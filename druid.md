# Druid

Druids devote their lives to studying the natural world. They are attuned to nature, and, in return, they draw magical power from it.  Most druids discover their powers by accident, rather than through training, but all of them learn to control the elements, the plants and beasts of the forests, hills, plains, and mountains, and the very essence of life itself.

**Note:** In the Harry Potter world, a druid is called an animagus.  Play with that a bit...

At every level, a druid adds their Wisdom bonus to their number of spell points.  Thus, a 14th level druid with a Wisdom of 16 (+3) would have an additional 42 points (14 x 3), for a total of 145 points.

**TODO:** Need to create a ~3rd level spell that permanently enchants an item, for use when creating magic items.

## Gaian Affinity

Druids are deeply attuned to their land in which they live.  The different lands of Gaia "feel" different, so a druid naturally gains an affinity to their native region of the continent.  These regions are the West, the East, the North, and the Center of the continent.  A druid who is not in their native lands is hampered by the unfamiliarity of their environment.  If you are not in your native land, your available spell points are temporarily reduced by 10%, and it takes an extra hour of communing with nature to regain your points.  Furthermore, if a druid from the West is in the East, or a Druid from the East is in the West, the extreme unfamiliarity reduces available points by 20% and requires two extra hours of Communing With Nature to regain spell points.

## Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast Spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and below for the druid spell list.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three Cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

## Spirit Animal

Starting at 2nd level, the DM will choose for you an animal with which you identify strongly; this animal becomes your *Spirit Animal*, and is the focus of most of your special abilities for the rest of your career.  Your spirit animal will be a non-magical beast of the same size as your character with a CR of 1/2 or less.  As your gain druid levels, you will gain more of the abilties of your spirit animal, including the ability to shapechange into your animal.

## Magic Sense

Starting at 2nd level, a druid can tell by looking at something if it's enchanted with nature (but not arcane) magic.  At 5th level, this ability improves so that they can also identify items enchanted with arcane magic.

## Wild Shape

Once you gain your spirit animal at 2nd level, you gain the ability to shapechange into this animal.  You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

## Creating magical potions and salves

At 3rd level, you automatically get the Botanist Feat, enabling you to make potions and salves.

## Spirit Animal Bleedover

*Needs a better name*

At 3rd level, you attunement with your spirit animal starts to express itself even when you are not transformed.  You gain one of the features of your animal even when you are not in Wild Shape (DM/player work together to decide).

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


## Improved Wild Shape

At 6th level, your abilty to shapechange into your spirit animal's form has improved. Not sure what that means yet.

Choose one of your ability scores that is associated with your spirit animal, and increase it by 1 point.


----

## Wild Shape Stuff

* Make a list of possible animals, group by CR and size.
* Determine what gradual abilities the animal will give you when you're not transformed for Spirit Animal Bleedover
* Determine which ability scores are important to the animal.

----
