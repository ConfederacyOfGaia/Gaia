# Druid

Druids devote their lives to studying the natural world. They are attuned to nature, and, in return, they draw magical power from it.  Most druids discover their powers by accident, rather than through training, but all of them learn to control the elements, the plants and beasts of the forests, hills, plains, and mountains, and the very essence of life itself.

At every level, a druid adds their Wisdom bonus to their number of spell points.  Thus, a 14th level druid with a Wisdom of 16 (+3) would have an additional 42 points (14 x 3), for a total of 145 points.

## Commune With Nature

This ability is identical to the Commune With Nature Feat.

## Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast Spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two Cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the cantrips Known column of the Druid table.


## Creating magical potions and salves

The process to create a potion or salve takes the correct materials, 2d10 hours minus 1 hour per druid level (minimum of 1 hour), and the casting of the spell that the potion or salve recreates. If the spell is cast at a higher level, the effect of the potion of salve is increased.  Most of this time is spent letting the potion cook/ferment/age/infuse, so the druid can rest or study, but cannot leave their work area.  At the end of the required time, the druid must make a Nature check (DC varies based on type of portion or salve) to see if the attempt succeeded.  The materials required vary based on the type of potion and spell, and can become quite expensive due to rarity or quantity.  The DM will have a complete list of the necessary ingredients.

## Circles

The circles from the PHB are available to druids (CIrcle of the Land and Circle of the Moon), as well as Circle of the Beast and Circle of Flora.
