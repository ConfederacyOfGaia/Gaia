# Cultures

Many character traits are defined by *culture*, not *race*, although D&D tends to treat them interchangably.

## The West

The Zephyrlands consists of several kingdoms.  The players begin the game in the Confederacy of Gaia, which occupy the entire center of the continent, but there are a few other countries to the north, south, and southeast, that have their own languages, cultures, and traditions.  Players may choose to have their characters be from one of these countries, in which case they will have different backgrounds to choose from.

THe peoples of the continent are collectively called *Zephyrans*, as is the common language.  Peoples from individual kingdoms speak their own lanaguages, and also speak Zephyran.

### The Confederacy of Gaia

The Confederacy of Gaia occupies the temperate belt that runs through the center of the continent.  Its population consists of humans and gnomes.  During the Great Devastation, when the orcs came down from the mountains, they ravaged the XXX Hills with fire and acid, and drove the gnomes out; Gaians now call them the Soothills, as nothing grows there, and the gnomes left forever and integrated into the human societies that would take them.  Gaia and Kylf absorbed the majority of the gnomes, and their cultures now carry the unmistakable signs of gnomish influence.

In Gaia, people speak Zephyran.  Some gnomes also speak Gnomish, though knowledge of the language has waned over the generations that the gnomes have been integrated into Gaian society.

### Selarius, The Elven Homelands

The elven homelands lie in the north/northeast-ish section of the Zephyrlands, in an isolated place that is very hard to find (some say it is protected by magic).

### Vella

**Vella** lies to the north of the Gaias, between the northern Western Ocean and the Thundersnow Tundra.  The inhabitants are called Vellians, and their language is Vellish.

### Kylf

**Kylf** lies to the east and northeast of Gaia.  The inhabitants are called Kylves, the adjectival form is Kylven, and their language is called Kylvish.  Kylf butts up agains the Soothills, and, like Gaia, has a large gnomish population.

Kylf is a country of rolling hills, and most Kylvens are herders and ranchers.  Kylven horses are renouned throughout Gaia for their speed and bravery, and the Kylven Dogsteed is the favored steed of gnomes throughout the Zephyrlands.

Kylf has a strong trade relationship with Gaia: Horses and livestock for produce.

### Genouj

Pronounced *ga-NOSH*.  Genouj lies to the south of Gaia, bordering the Southern Sea and the central mountains.  Genouj is a hot, arid land, populated almost exclusively by humans; elves and gnomes find its temperatures too inhospitable.  The peoples are called Genoujians (*ga-NOSH-ens*), as is the language.
