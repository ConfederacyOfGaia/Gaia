# Cultures

## The West

Western Gaia consists of several countries.  The players begin the game in the Zephyrlands, which occupy the entire center of the continent, but there are a few other countries to the north, south, and southeast, that have their own languages, cultures, and traditions.  Players may choose to have their characters be from one of these countries, in which case they will have different backgrounds to choose from.

### The Zephyrlands

The Zephyrlands occupies the temperate belt that runs through the center of the continent.  Its population consists of humans and gnomes.  During the Great Devastation, when the orcs came down from the mountains, they drove the gnomes out of the XXX Hills and ravaged them with fire and acid; Zephyrans now call them the Soothills, as nothing grows there, and the gnomes left forever and integrated into the human societies that would take them.  The Zephyrlands and Kylf absorbed the majority fo the gnomes.

### The Elven Homelands

The elven homelands lie in the north/northeast-ish section of the Zephyrlands, in an isolated place that is very hard to get to (some say it is protected by magic).  Need to define what this means.

### Vell

**Vell** lies to the north of the Zephyrlands, between the northern Western Ocean and the Thundersnow Tundra.  The inhabitants are called Vellians, as is their language.

### Kylf

**Kylf** lies to the east and northeast of the Zephyrlands.  The inhabitants are called Kylves, the adjectival form is Kylven, and their language is called Kylvish.  Kylf butts up agains the Soothills, and, like the Zephyrlands, has a large gnomish population.

### Genouj

Pronounced *ga-NOSH*.  Genouj lies to the south of the Zephyrlands, bordering the Southern Sea and the central mountains.  Genouj is a hot, arid land, populated almost exclusively by humans; elves and gnomes find its temperatures too inhospitable.  The peoples are called Genoujians (*ga-NOSH-ens*), as if the language.
