# Cultures

Many character traits are defined by *culture*, not *race*, although D&D tends to treat them interchangably.

## The West

The Zephyrlands currently consists of several kingdoms, but until the Great Devastation, they were all part of the same Zephyran empire.  This means they share a culture and a common language, flavored with regional differences that are left over from the pre-imperal kingdoms.  After the Greate Devastation, the kingdoms mostly reverted to their old boundaries, but kept many of the Zephyran conventions and culture.

The players begin the game in the Confederacy of Gaia, which occupie the entire center of the continent.  Players may choose to have their characters be from one of these countries, in which case they will have different backgrounds to choose from.

THe peoples of the continent are collectively called *Zephyrans*, as is the common language.  Peoples from individual kingdoms speak their own lanaguages, and also speak Zephyran.

### The Confederacy of Gaia

**The Confederacy of Gaia** occupies the temperate belt that runs through the center of the continent.  The heart of the Zephyran Empire was in Gaia, and the language, culture, and traditions of Gaia are what the empire spread to its vassals.

The population of Gaia consists of humans and gnomes.  During the Great Devastation, when the orcs came down from the mountains, they ravaged the XXX Hills with fire and acid, and drove the gnomes out; Gaians now call them the Soothills, as nothing grows there, and the gnomes left forever and integrated into the human societies that would take them.  Gaia absorbed the majority of the gnomes (though many settled in Kylf as well), and Gaian culture now carries the unmistakable signs of gnomish influence.

In Gaia, people speak Zephyran.  Some gnomes also speak Gnomish, though knowledge of the language has waned over the generations that the gnomes have been integrated into Gaian society.

### Vella

**Vella** lies to the north and northwest of Gaia, between the northern Western Ocean and the Thundersnow Tundra.  The inhabitants are called Vellans, and their language is Vellish.

Vella butts up against the Thundersnow Tundra to the north and many wheels of grassland to the south. 

### Kylf

**Kylf** lies to the east and northeast of Gaia.  The inhabitants are called Kylves, the adjectival form is Kylven, and their language is called Kylvish.  Kylf butts up agains the Soothills, and, like Gaia, has a substantial gnomish population.

Kylf is a country of rolling hills, and most Kylvens are herders and ranchers.  Kylven horses are renouned throughout Gaia for their speed and bravery, and the Kylven Dogsteed is the favored steed of gnomes throughout the Zephyrlands.

Kylf has a strong trade relationship with Gaia: Horses and livestock for produce.

### Genouj

Pronounced *ga-NOSH*.  Genouj lies to the south of Gaia, bordering the Southern Sea and the central mountains.  Genouj is a hot, arid land, populated almost exclusively by humans; elves and gnomes find its temperatures too inhospitable.  The peoples are called Genoujians (*ga-NOSH-ens*), as is the language.


### Selarius, The Elven Homelands

The elven homelands lie in the north/northeast-ish section of the Zephyrlands, in an isolated place that is very hard to find (some say it is protected by magic).
