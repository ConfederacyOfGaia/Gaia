### Great Draconic Bloodline

The magic of the Great Dragons has begun to fill the world, and the Great Dragons that rule the various empires of Enda have taken to exploring their empires in humanoid form.  Occasionally, the Great Dragons have taken a prurient interest in a human, elf, or goliath, and the resulting offspring has a streak of the Great Dragon in it.

#### Don't Quit Your Day Job

There are no professional magic wielders, which means you have the standard set of adventuring skills in addition to your spellcasting abilities, and you probably dress as a warrior or commoner.  At 1st level, you gain proficiency with light armor and simple weapons, and your hit die becomes a d8 instead of a d6.  Your list of skill choices changes to **Deception**, **History**, **Insight**, **Investigation**, **Nature**, **Perception**, and **Survival**.

- Choose which Great Dragon: Gold, Crimson, Indigo, or Ebony.
  - Gold: ???
  - Crimson: fire
  - Indigo: lightning
  - Ebony: acid
- No dependency on the moons, because the magic is manifested directly in yourself

Otherwise, identical to standard Draconic Bloodline.
