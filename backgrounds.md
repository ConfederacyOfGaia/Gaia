# Backgrounds

The following backgrounds are unique to the Confederacy of Gaia.

## Artisan or Merchant

You have proficiency with the tools of their trade and proficiency with the History skill as it related to their craft or trade.  Starting money will be 5d4x10, and they will start with the tools required by their trade.  If the character is an artisan, they are likely an apprentice, or the child of an artisan, but there are other options; for example, the character might have been a blacksmith whose forge burned down, and rather than rebuild they chose a wandering life.

## Gnomish Craftsman

*Prerequisite: Gnome*

Gnomish Craftsmen are legendary metalworkers, miners, masons, brewers, and artisans.  Pick a craft, and you begin play with proficiency in the tools of your trade, and proficiency in the History skill, related to your craft.  Gnomish Craftsmen start the game with 10d4x10 gilders and the tools of your craft (if any).

## Farmer

*Prerequisite: Human*

You come from a family of farmers.  You can choose either the Nature or Survival skill in addition to your class skills.  
Being a farmer doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.

## Rancher

*Prerequisite: Human*

Your family are ranchers, so you get the Animal Handling skill in addition to your class skills.  Being a rancher doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.

## Outlander

*Prerequisite: Human*

You are a member of one of the outlander caravans.  You know how to play a musical instrument of your choice, know the Outlander language, and automatically gain the Survival skill. Starting money for outlanders is very low, 1d4x10, but they will already have access to most equipment they will need, having been acquired from the community.
