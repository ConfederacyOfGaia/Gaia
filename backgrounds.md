# Backgrounds

The following backgrounds are available to players in Gaia.  If these are specific to a culture or region, this is noted in the prerequisites.

Most human and gnomish adults living in Zephyran towns and villages are part of the local militia, and train once per week.  This is represented by taking the Zephyran Milita background, in addition to the PC's primary background.  If the PC fits this demographic and does not have this background, there should be an in-game reason for it.

## Artisan

You have proficiency with the tools of your trade, and proficiency with the History skill as it relates to your craft or trade. In addition, add +1 to either Dexterity or Charisma, as appropriate for your craft.  Starting money is 5d4x10, and you start with the tools required by your trade.

## Gnomish Craftsman

*Prerequisite: Gnome, Zephyran or Kylven*

Gnomish Craftsmen are legendary metalworkers, miners, masons, brewers, and artisans.  Pick a craft, and you begin play with proficiency in the tools of your trade, and proficiency in the History skill as it relates to your craft.  As part of your connection to your heritage, you also speak, read, and write the gnomish language.  Gnomish Craftsmen start the game with 10d4x10 gilders and the tools of your craft (if any).

## Farmer

*Prerequisite: Human*

You come from a family of farmers.  You can choose either the Nature or Survival skill in addition to your class skills.  
Being a farmer doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.  Most farmers are from the Zephyrlands.

## Outlander

*Prerequisite: Human*

You are a member of one of the outlander caravans.  You know how to play a musical instrument of your choice, know the Outlander language, and automatically gain the Survival skill. Starting money for outlanders is very low, 1d4x10, but they will already have access to most equipment they will need, having been acquired from the community.  If you take the outlander background, you cannot take the Zephyran Militia background.

## Rancher

*Prerequisite: Human*

Your family are ranchers, so you get the Animal Handling skill in addition to your class skills.  Being a rancher doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.  Kylf is known for its ranchers, and they are rare in the Zephyrlands.

## Zephyran Militia

*Prerequisite: Human or gnome; another Zephyran background*

You are part of the militia of your home village.  Every week, you train in arms with the other adults of your village.  In addition to your class skills, you have proficiency in spear, shortsword, shortbow, unarmed combat (see below), and light armor.  You also gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. As a member of an active militia, you are expected to train every week, and if you are absent, your sargeant will want to know why.

Your unarmed combat stats:

* When wearing light armor or no armor, and not carrying a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Wisdom bonus + your Dexterity bonus.
* Your unarmed strikes do 1d4 damage.
* When you make an unarmed strike as your Action, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action, provided you haven't taking another bonus action.

This background works differently than the others; when you take it, you take it as a bonus background, and list it on your character sheet as, e.g., **Farmer / Zephyran Militia**.
