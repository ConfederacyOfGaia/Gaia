# Backgrounds

The following backgrounds are available to players in Gaia.  If these are specific to a culture or region, this is noted in the prerequisites.

Most human and gnomish adults living in Zephyran towns and villages are part of the local militia, and train once per week.  This is represented by taking the Zephyran Milita background, in addition to the PC's primary background.  If the PC fits this demographic and does not have this background, there should be an in-game reason for it.

## Artisan

You are a skilled artisan or craftsman, such as a blacksmith, cooper, tinsmith, shoemaker, tailor, carpenter, mason, butcher, brewer, etc.  Depending on your age, you might the master, or you might be an apprentice or journeyman.  During downtime, you can find work and earn money by plying your trade. You start with the tools required by your trade.  Work with the DM to fill in the details.

___
- **Ability Score Increase:** +1 to Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma, as appropriate for your trade
- **Skill Proficiencies:** History (related to your craft), Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Appropriate tools
- **Languages:** As appropriate for your craft
- **Equipment:** The tools of your trade
- **Starting Money:** 5d4x10

## Farmer

*Prerequisite: Human*

You come from a family of farmers.  You can choose either the Nature or Survival skill in addition to your class skills.  
Being a farmer doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.  Most farmers are from the Zephyrlands.

___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Nature or Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** None
- **Equipment:** 
- **Starting Money:** 2d20x10

## Genoujian Slave

*Prerequisite: Genoujian male*

This generic-sounding background is purposefully generic:  Genoujian males are treated  like slaves in their home lands, and only by escaping to become adventurers can they gain any amount of agency.  Since Genouj doesn't allow their males to leave their designated jobs, you most likely ran away, and so have very little in the way of money or equipment.  Jobs for males vary, but they are all very physically demanding, so you are a physically-impressive and very healthy specimin:  The job unrelentingly weeds out weak males.  As such, you start the game with either the Tough or Durable Feat and have advantage on all Constitution checks.

___
- **Ability Score Increase:** +1 to Strength, Dexterity, and Constution
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics and Acrobatics
- **Tool Proficiencies:** None
- **Feats:** Durable or Tough
- **Languages:** Genoujian
- **Equipment:** None

*Need a background for a Genoujian Breeder, a male whose purpose is to impregnate Genoujian females.*

## Gnomish Craftsman

*Prerequisite: Gnome, Zephyran or Kylven*

Gnomish Craftsmen are legendary metalworkers, miners, masons, brewers, and artisans.  Pick a craft, and you begin play with proficiency in the tools of your trade, and proficiency in the History skill as it relates to your craft.  As part of your connection to your heritage, you also speak, read, and write the gnomish language.  Gnomish Craftsmen start the game with 10d4x10 gilders and the tools of your craft (if any).

___
- **Ability Score Increase:** +1 to Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma, as appropriate for your trade
- **Skill Proficiencies:** History (related to your craft), Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Appropriate tools
- **Languages:** Zephyran, Gnomish, possibly Kylven
- **Equipment:** The tools of your trade
- **Starting Money:** 

## Mudorian Sailor

*Prerequisite: Mudorian*

A Mudorian sailor, with experience working on an ocean-going ship and the appropriate skills.
___
- **Ability Score Increase:** 
- **Skill Proficiencies:** History (related to the sea), Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** 
- **Languages:** Zephyrian
- **Equipment:** 
- **Starting Money:** 


## Outlander

*Prerequisite: Human*

You are a member of one of the outlander caravans.  You know how to play a musical instrument of your choice, know the Outlander language, and automatically gain the Survival skill. Starting money for outlanders is very low, 1d4x10, but they will already have access to most equipment they will need, having been acquired from the community.  If you take the outlander background, you cannot take the Zephyran Militia background.

___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** 
- **Tool Proficiencies:** 
- **Languages:** 
- **Equipment:** 
- **Starting Money:** 

## Rancher

*Prerequisite: Human*

Your family are ranchers, so you get the Animal Handling skill in addition to your class skills.  Being a rancher doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.  Kylf is known for its ranchers, and they are rare in the Zephyrlands.

___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** 
- **Tool Proficiencies:** 
- **Languages:** 
- **Equipment:** 
- **Starting Money:** 

## Zephyran Militia

*Prerequisite: Human or gnome; another Zephyran background*

You are part of the militia of your home village.  Every week, you train in arms with the other adults of your village.  In addition to your class skills, you have proficiency in spear, shortsword, shortbow, unarmed combat (see below), and light armor.  You also gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. As a member of an active militia, you are expected to train every week, and if you are absent, your sargeant will want to know why.

Your unarmed combat stats:

* When wearing light armor or no armor, and not carrying a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Wisdom bonus + your Dexterity bonus.
* Your unarmed strikes do 1d4 damage.
* When you make an unarmed strike as your Action, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action, provided you haven't taking another bonus action.

This background works differently than the others; when you take it, you take it as a bonus background, and list it on your character sheet as, e.g., **Farmer / Zephyran Militia**.
