Life in Gaia can be tough, and everyone appreciates a strong warrior.  Fighters comprise the militias, caravan guards, and most of the adventurers of the world.  They are the battle masters, the champions of combat, and the master tacticians.

### Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a fighting style from the list of optional features. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack rolls you make with Ranged Weapons.

#### Arnis

You use a fighting style that revolves around [bastons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baston_%28weapon%29).  When wielding a pair of bastons, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC and get a bonus attack.  You can also add your ability modifier to the damage of the second baston.  When using this fighting style, you cannot use a shield.  Note that this fighting style differs from Two-Weapon Fighting; it includes a lot of feints and flourishes, which is what provides the AC bonus, but it requires the use of the baston and cannot be generalized to other weapons.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

```
```

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other Weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to Damage Rolls with that weapon.

#### Fistfighting

You have mastered fighting with your bare fists:  You automatically gain the Martial Artist Feat, and your unarmed fighting style is bare-knuckle boxing and grappling.

#### Flinger

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made when throwing a weapon or using a sling.  In addition, every melee weapon you are wielding has the thrown (range 10/30) property.

#### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an Attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

\page

#### Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the Attack roll. You must be wielding a Shield.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second Attack.

### Second Wind

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On Your Turn, you can use a Bonus Action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On Your Turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible Bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Martial Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your Combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

Some of these archetypes are culture-specific, and will only be available to characters from that culture; for example, mastering the skills needed to become a Mounted Knight or Mounted Archer is simply not possible without a Kylven teacher.  Others will be available in all cultures, though they might be rare or have a slightly different flavor in different cultures.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternately, you can choose to forgo the ability score increase and take a Feat instead.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can Attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on Your Turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Indomitable

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.

## Martial Archetypes

Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

### Battle Master

Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weapon smithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

#### Combat Superiority

You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers from the maneuver list. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. 

**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.  You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is 8+ your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

#### Student of War

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

#### Know Your Enemy

Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interating with another creature outside comnat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own.  The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following charactistics of your choice:  

* Strength score
* Dexterity score
* Constitution score
* Armor Class
* Current hit points
* Total class levels (if applicable)

### Brawler

Though many creative-minded fighters employ fists and other natural weapons in combat, a Brawler hones their physical advantages and perfects the art of fistfighting.

#### Restriction: Fistfighting Fighting Style

Before learning the advanced techniques Brawlers come to master, a novice must first grasp the fundamentals of fighting with one's fists.  Unlike other restrictions based on race and social standing, it is not advised that the DM waive this particular restriction, as many Brawler features build upon a basic knowledge of fist fighting.

\page

#### Counterpunch 

Beginning at 3rd level, you are adept at fighting freehanded in the midst of battle.  When you are targetted by a melee attack and it deals damage, you may use your reaction to attempt to move with the momentum of the blow, decreasing the damage dealt by an amount equal to the damage die of your unarmed strike + your Fighter level.  If the damage is reduced to 0, you can make a single unarmed strike attack against the attacking creature as a part of the same reaction.  You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before you must take a short or long rest to refresh its uses.

If this grapphle succeeds, the creature ends its movement adjacent to you.  A creature you are grappling has disadvantage on attacks it makes against you.

#### Fistfighter's Momentum

Beginning at 15th level, you can draw your vigor from the brutal tempo of combat.  Whenever you use an Action Surge or when a creature drops to 0 hit points within 15 feet of you, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Strength modifier + your Constituion modifier.  These temporary hit points last for up to a minute after you gain them.

#### Knockout Punch

Starting at 18th level, your strikes are so powerful that they can knock an enemy senseless.  The first time on each of your turns that you reduce a creature's hit points to 15 or less with an unarmed strike, that creature is immediately rendered unconscious for up to one minute, or until another creature uses an action to route them.

You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

### Mounted Knight

Mounted Knights are one of the specialties of Kylven fighters, who are born in the saddle and ride their whole lives.  They are a colossus on the battlefield who can shrug off attacks and protect allies from harm. Mounted Knights fight from the saddle when they can, and in combat they are expected to seek out and lock down the mightiest of the enemy’s forces. On adventures, they are the armored bulwark that strives to keep the rest of the party safe.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, or Persuasion. You can choose to gain one tool proficiency in place of one skill proficiency.

#### Born to the Saddle

Starting at 3rd level, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off it, you can automatically land on your feet if you aren’t incapacitated and you fall less than 10 feet.

Additionally, when mounted, you and the creature you are riding gain a +1 to your AC.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Using Superiority Dice.** You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a check to influence or control a creature you are riding, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.
* When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.
\page
* When you make an attack with a lance while mounted, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, the target of the attack must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.
* If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount’s AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount take half damage from it.

#### Ferocious Charger

At 7th level, you gain additional benefits when you use superiority dice to increase your damage when you attack with a lance or spear.

### Mounted Archer

Mounted Archers are one of the specialities of Kylven fighters, who are born in the saddle and ride their whole lives.

#### Restriction: Archery Style

In order to choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have to have taken the Archery fighting style at 1st level.  Longbows are too large to use while mounted, so the Mounted Archer uses a shortbow.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, or Persuasion. You can choose to gain one tool proficiency in place of one skill proficiency.

#### Born to the Saddle

Starting at 3rd level, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off it, you can automatically land on your feet if you aren’t incapacitated and you fall less than 10 feet.

Additionally, when mounted, you and the creature you are riding gain a +2 to your AC.  This is higher than the Mounted Knight because the tactics used by the Mounted Archer emphasize speed, distance, and agility, so they make a more difficult target.

#### Archery Superiority

At 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

**Using Surpiority Dice.** You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a check to influence or control a creature you are riding, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.
* When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.
* When you make a ranged attack while mounted, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, the target of the attack must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.
* If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount’s AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount take half damage from it.

#### Sniper

At 6th level, learn a specific type of patient, aimed attack that is specific to Kylven Mounted Archer.  The archer approaches on his mount, using his action to aim carefully at a chosen target while closing the distance, and on the next round the attack is made with advantage.  If the attack hits, add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

#### Improved Combat Superiority

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

#### Restriction: Archery Style

In order to choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have to have taken the Archery fighting style at 1st level.

#### Steady Aim

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you’re wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain three benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* You have advantage on your attacks against that creature.
* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

\page

#### Careful Eyes

Starting at 7th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action as a bonus action. You also gain proficiency in the Perception, Investigation, or Survival skill (choose one).

#### Close-Quarters Shooting

At 10th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll.

In addition, if you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can’t take reactions until the end of this turn.

#### Rapid Strike

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### Snap Shot

Starting at 18th level, you are ever ready to spring into action. If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.
