At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your Combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

Each culture has a favored archetype:

* In Gaia, it is the Champion, the Battle Master, or the Arcane Archer.
* In Kylf, it is the Mounted Knight and the Mounted Archer.
* In Vell, it is ...
* In the elven homelands, it is Arcane Archer, ...

Some of these archetypes will only be available to characters that grew up in that culture; for example, mastering the skills needed to become a Mounted Knight or Mounted Archer is simply not possible without a Kylven teacher.  Others will be available in all cultures, though they might be rare or have a slightly different flavor. grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

## Martial Archetypes

Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

### Brawler

Though many creative-minded fighters employ fists and other natural weapons in combat, a Brawler hones their physical advantages and perfects the art of fistfighting.

#### Restriction: Fistfighting Fighting Style

Before learning the advanced techniques Brawlers come to master, a novice must first grasp the fundamentals of fighting with one's fists.  Unlike other restrictions based on race and social standing, it is not advised that the DM waive this particular restriction, as many Brawler features build upon a basic knowledge of fistfighting.

#### Counterpunch 

Beginning at 3rd level, you are adept at fighting freehanded in the midst of battle.  When you are targetted by a melee attack and it deals damage, you may use your reaction to attempt to move with the momentum of the blow, decreasing the damage dealt by an amount equal to the damage die of your unarmed strike + your Fighter level.  If the damage is reduced to 0, you can make a single unarmed strike attack against the attacking creature as a part of the same reaction.  You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before you must take a short or long rest to refresh its uses.

#### Fistfighting Mastery

At 7th level, you gain the Martial Arts Master Feat.  Additionally, your unarmed strikes gain an almost supernatural potency, overcoming resistance and immunities as if they were magical.

#### Vice Grip

Starting at 10th level, you are able to place your opponets in quick, debilitating grapples.  When you have a free hand and an opponent provokes an opportunity attack by leaving the reach of your unarmed strike, you may replace its attack with an attempted grapple.  If this grapphle succeeds, the creature ends its movement adjacent to you.  A creature you are grappling has disadvantage on attacks it makes against you.

#### Fistfighter's Momentum

Beginning at 15th level, you can draw your vigor from the brutal tempo of combat.  Whenever you use an Action Surge or when a creature drops to 0 hit points within 15 feet of you, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Strength modifier + your Constituion modifier.  These temporary hit points last for up to a minute after you gain them.

#### Knockout Punch

Starting at 18th level, your strikes are so powerful that they can knock an enemy senseless.  The first time on each of your turns that you reduce a creature's hit points to 15 or less with an unarmed strike, that creature is immediately rendered unconscious for up to one minute, or until another creature uses an action to route them.

### Champion

The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous Training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.

#### Improved Critical

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

#### Remarkable Athlete

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

#### Additional Fighting Style

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

#### Superior Critical

Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.

#### Survivor

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left.

You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

### Mounted Knight

Mounted Knights are one of the specialties of Kylven fighters, who are born in the saddle and ride their whole lives.  They are a colossus on the battlefield who can shrug off attacks and protect allies from harm. Mounted Knights fight from the saddle when they can, and in combat they are expected to seek out and lock down the mightiest of the enemy’s forces. On adventures, they are the armored bulwark that strives to keep the rest of the party safe.

#### Born to the Saddle

Starting at 3rd level, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off it, you can automatically land on your feet if you aren’t incapacitated and you fall less than 10 feet.

Additionally, when mounted, you and the creature you are riding gain a +1 to your AC.

#### Implacable Mark

At 3rd level, you excel at foiling attacks and protecting your allies by menacing your foes. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the target is marked by you until the end of your next turn. A creature ignores this effect if the creature can’t be frightened.

The marked target has disadvantage on any attack roll against a creature other than you or someone else who marked it.

If a target marked by you is within 5 feet of you on its turn and it moves at least 1 foot or makes an attack that suffers disadvantage from this feature, you can make one melee weapon attack against it using your reaction. This attack roll has advantage, and if it hits, the attack’s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to your fighter level.

You can make this special attack even if you have already expended your reaction this round, but not if you have already used your reaction this turn. You can make this attack three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Noble Cavalry

At 7th level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Persuasion, or Religion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

#### Hold the Line

At 10th level, you master the ability to harass and slow your enemies. As a reaction when a creature moves at least 1 foot within 5 feet of you, you can make one melee weapon attack against that creature. If you hit, the attack’s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level, and the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of this turn.

#### Rapid Strike

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### Defender’s Blade

At 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. You can use your reaction for an opportunity attack even if you have already expended your reaction this round, but not if you have already used your reaction this turn.

### Mounted Archer

Mounted Archers are one of the specialities of Kylven fighters, who are born in the saddle and ride their whole lives.

#### Ability 1

Additionally, when mounted, you and the creature you are riding gain a +1 to your AC.

#### Ability 2

#### Ability 3

#### Ability 4

### Sharpshooter

The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

#### Steady Aim

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you’re wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.

* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Careful Eyes

Starting at 7th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action as a bonus action. You also gain proficiency in the Perception, Investigation, or Survival skill (choose one).

#### Close-Quarters Shooting

At 10th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll.

In addition, if you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can’t take reactions until the end of this turn.

#### Rapid Strike

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### Snap Shot

Starting at 18th level, you are ever ready to spring into action. If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.

### Sohei

*This doesn't really fit the overall flavor of the campaign, and should probably be removed*

Renown warrior monks, the sohei are detailed here as a fighter martial archetype rather than a monastic order because they focus more on the warrior aspect as opposed to the spiritual aspect that is common among other monks.

These are a group of people whose purpose is to defend the temples, monasteries, and special interests of their spiritual leaders without needing to have any particular spiritual affinity themselves. They are trained in martial combat as well as any fighter, but because of their relationship with monasteries and temples, have been able to integrate some of those monk-like qualities into their training.

When choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following:

#### Unarmored Defense

When not wearing armor or using a shield, your base AC becomes 10+STR+DEX.

#### Unarmed Attacks

You base damage for unarmed attacks is 1d4 bludgeoning. This becomes 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.

#### Ironskin

Upon reaching 7th level, you gain resistance against all non magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

#### Ironfist

Starting at 10th level, your unarmed attacks can smash through 1 inch of wood, or 1/ 2 inch of stone per fighter level.  Additionally, your unarmed strikes are treated as magical weapons for purposes of what they can hit.

#### Immovable

When you achieve 15th level, you gain advantage on all athletic skill and grapple checks. You are also immune to being shoved, pushed, or pulled against your will.

#### Zen

At 18th level, once per long rest, you can cast each of the following one time: *levitate*, *meld into stone*, and *feather fall*. You use the minimum level slot available in terms of spell affect.

### Available ones:

* Champion.  Per PHB 72.
* Battle Master.  Per PHB 73.
* Kensai.  Specializes in a single weapon (needs clarification)
* Arcane Archer. Per this doc.
