# Fighter

Life in Gaia can be tough, and everyone appreciates a strong warrior.  Fighters comprise the militias, caravan guards, and most of the adventurers of the world.  They are the battle masters, the champions of combat, and the master tacticians.

Almost options from the PHB are available here, with the exception of the Eldritch Knight archetype.  The Brawler martial archetype is available.

## Martial Archetypes

Each culture has a favored archetype:

* In the Zephyrlands, it is the Champion, the Battle Master, or the Arcane Archer.
* In Kylf, it is the Mounted Knight and the Mounted Archer.
* In Vell, it is ...
* In the elven homelands, it is Arcane Archer, ...

Some of these archetypes will only be available to characters that grew up in that culture; for example, mastering the skills needed to become a Mounted Knight or Mounted Archer is simply not possible without a Kylven teacher.  Others will be available in all cultures, though they might be rare or have a slightly different flavor.
