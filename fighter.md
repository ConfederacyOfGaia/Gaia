# Fighter

Life in Gaia can be tough, and everyone appreciates a strong warrior.  Fighters comprise the militias, caravan guards, and most of the adventurers of the world.  They are the battle masters, the champions of combat, and the master tacticians.

Almost options from the PHB are available here, with the exception of the Eldritch Knight archetype.  The Brawler martial archetype is available.
