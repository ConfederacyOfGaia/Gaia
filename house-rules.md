# House Rules

The following house rules are in effect for Gaia.

## Misc House Rules

* All mages get the Prestidigitation cantrip
* Add druids get the Druidcraft cantrip
* Passive Perception/Investigation values replace any respective Active check that is lower
* When fighting groups of 4 to 7 enemies, award 150% standard XP
* When fighting groups of more than 7 enemies, award 200% standard XP

## Feats

During the character creation process, after choosing class skills but before playing, you can choose a Skill-Related Feat from the [Feats For Skills](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UA-SkillFeats.pdf) article.  This indicates a matery of this particular skill in your past.  If possible, this should be integrated into your character background and consistent with your history.

## Critical Hits and Critical Failures

* A critical hit is max damage plus the roll. It ensures crits are better than normal hits.
  * This should be in effect for adversaries, as well!
* A critical failure uses Conan-style rules: weapon lodged in a tree or ground, weapon dropped, hit a nearby piece of architecture, and so on.  No collateral damage unless doing something insace like firing into melee.
  * Alternately, no critical miss rules at all.

## Increasing Skills

Consider a player who wants her PC to acquire a +1 bonus on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Almost always the starting point is "Nearly Impossible": DC30. Using the mechanics for learning a language as a model, the PC would need to find a teacher, or practice on her own. A teacher would need to be someone who knows something about Dexterity (Stealth) that the PC doesn't; while it is conceivable that anyone might know some element of stealth that the PC doesn't, someone with a Dexterity (Stealth) modifier higher than the PCs certainly does. For this reason (and to adhere to the principles of bounded accuracy) the PC must find a teacher with a higher modifier in the skill than the PC. This will typically be an Intelligence (Investigation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check of 20 + PCs existing skill check.

Each day the teacher needs to make DC20 Charisma (Performance) check for the PC to have a chance to make progress towards gaining her +1 bonus. On days when the teacher makes his check, if the PC makes an Intelligence check to see if she has made progress towards learning enough about Stealth to get a +1 bonus. If the Intelligence check hits the DC30 mark, she has learned enough to get the +1 bonus. If the Intelligence check falls below the DC30 mark, but hits the DC15 mark then the PC has learned something that gives her some incremental progress towards the +1 bonus and gets +1 to subsequent Intelligence checks (cumulative) on the matter.

Alternately, if no teacher is available, the PC could just practice Dexterity (Stealth) each day in the hopes of learning enough to get a +1 bonus on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The PC attempts a Dexterity (Stealth) check representing the day's practice. If the check hits a DC20 she may have learned something during the practice session get a +1 bonus on Stealth checks. She can make a subsequent Intelligence check. If she hits a DC30 then she has learned enough to get a +1 bonus on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If she hits a DC20 on the Intelligence check then she has made some incremental progress gaining a +1 bonus (cumulative) on future Intelligence checks to gain the +1 bonus.

Once the PC gains the +1 bonus she needs to give the trait a "title" for her character sheet.

## Building Encounters

*Source: [Sly Flourish: Building Encounters in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons](http://slyflourish.com/5e_encounter_building.html)*

1. Start with the story. What encounter and monsters make sense?
1. Select story-appropriate monsters with a challenge rating (CR) roughly equivalent to the characters's level or below.
1. Choose the number of monsters by comparing the monster's challenge rating to the character's level. Note, these ratios assume a "hard" encounter.
   1. For monsters with a challenge rating of 1/4 the character's level, use two monsters per character.
   1. For monsters with a challenge rating of 1/3 the character's level, use one monster per character.
   1. For monsters with a challenge rating of 3/4 the character's level, use one monster per two characters.
   1. For monsters with a challenge rating equal to or above the character's level, use one monster per four characters.
1. Adjust difficulty by adding or subtracting monsters or adjusting hit points.
1. Evaluate the action economy. Too few monsters will make the battle much easier. Aim for at least one monster for the first four characters plus one creature for each additional character.

## Learning a Language

Learning a language according to the presentation of the PHB requires 250 downtime days to complete which is an unrealistic amount of downtime. A character would most likely be close to retirement before she could be close to that threshold.

Furthermore, it doesn't model the way languages and tool proficiencies are actually learned in the real world. There is tremendous variance based on intellect and aptitude, and the method for learning a language outlined in this section better models that variance than the method described in the PHB.

Players may learn additional languages beyond the ones they start with. There is no hard cap on the number of languages a character can learn, and indeed the more languages a character knows the easier it is for her to learn a new one.

There are two ways to learn a new language: with a teacher or through immersion.

### Teacher method

Using a teacher to learn a new language, a character must first find a teacher who knows the desired language and a language that the character knows. The difficulty of finding a teacher depends on the language and the region the character is searching in.

Having found a suitable teacher, if the character spends at least three hours a day with the teacher attempting to teach her the language, then the possibility exists that the teacher has taught the character the language or at least some aspects of the language.

It is hard to teach someone a new language, so first the teacher must make a DC20 Charisma (Performance) check to see if he has successfully conveyed what he knows about the language. If there is a second teacher available, this check can be made with advantage. If the teacher succeeds in his Performance check, then the character is entitled to an Intelligence check; the character receives a +1 bonus to this check for every language above one that she speaks currently. If the Intelligence check is at least a 15, then the character has learned some elements of the language, but still does not know enough to speak it. This has the effect of giving future possible teachers of the same language a +1 bonus to their Performance checks as teachers, and the character a +1 bonus to her Intelligence check to learn the language.

This +1 bonus is cumulative with each Intelligence check that is 15+. If the Intelligence check is 25 or better, the character has learned enough to carry on conversations in the language. The character will have a heavy accent, she will make frequent grammatical mistakes, and her vocabulary is limited, but she can usually get her point across and follow the conversations of fluent speakers. If the Intelligence check is a 30+, the character has learned to be fluent in the language.

### Immersion Method

A character living in a community where the language used in the majority of situations is unknown to the character has an opportunity to learn that language. At the end of any day in which the character has interacted with the populace (gone to the market, went to the tavern, etc.) The character makes an Intelligence check. The character gets a +1 bonus for every language above one that she knows already. If the check is a 20+ then the character has gained an insight into the new language; she will get a +1 bonus (cumulative) on future checks to determine if she has learned the language.

If the Intelligence check is 25 or better, the character has learned enough to carry on conversations in the language. The character will have a heavy accent, she will make frequent grammatical mistakes, and her vocabulary is limited, but she can usually get her point across and can follow the conversations of fluent speakers. If the Intelligence check is a 30+, the character has learned to be fluent in the language.
