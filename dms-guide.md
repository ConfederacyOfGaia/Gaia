# A DM's Guide to the Zephyrlands

This guide is a supplement to the [Player's Guide to the Age of the Great Dragons](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/By7LYLm1Rz), providing additional details, context, mechanics, and lore.  Some of the lore and mechanics will be propagated to the Player's Guide once it is discovered (e.g., orcs).


## The Cycle of the Great Dragons

The current ***Age of the Great Dragons*** is just the latest cycle in a saga that has been ongoing for millena.  Once every thousand years, the Great Dragons emerge from their home deep in the Sunbloom Mountains, conquer the lands, and have offspring.  They conquer the lands so that they are under control when the young emerge, and are not endangered.  The parent dragons then die of old age, and their offspring rule for 500 years and then return to hibernation for 500 years.  During the dragons' rule, most of the humanoids are killed off, and their civilization slowly rebuilds itself after the dragons return to hibernation, which is why they are still relatively technologically non-advanced.  During each cycle, magic returns to the land, and great sorcerers arise and create works of wonder and great power, but they inevitably die off during the resulting extinctions.

All the magical weapons and artifacts that exist are created during the first few decades of the dragons' emergence, after the conquer the humanoids but before they are genocided.

### Notes

When the Great Dragons come, their magic causes lots of effects:

- Mutation of the Noble Races into the ignoble Races
- Raising the dead into wights
- Infusing magic into gemstones

Every cycle, the noble races start mutating into the ignoble races until they outnumber them. The ignoble races eventually overrun the cities and destroy most of the nobles. This causes the Dragons to return to their slumber, which causes the magic to leave the world. This in turn causes the ignoble races to start to die off, and the noble races slowly rebuild their civilizations. This cycle has been ongoing for thousands of years.

The orcs, because of the seclusion of the Bowl of Fire, have been able to keep detailed histories of these events, but none if the other races have.

The ignoble races are all cruel, vicious, and stupid. They are savage fighters, do not take prisoners, and always fight to the death. They are cannibalistic, preferring their own noble cousins to other humanoids. In combat, they will target their noble cousins preferentially. Occasionally, one of them will develop the ability to harness magic, especially goblins, but this magic is always poorly controlled and unsubtle.

The ignoble races start appearing almost immediately: within 5 years.  The ignoble races breed and mature at twice the rate of the noble races, so there are always a lot of them.

Within the first hundred years, the noble races learn to harnesss magic and to create enchanted weapons, armor, and wondrous items. Many of these are taken it destroyed by the ignoble raiders, but some remain. They are too stupid to attune to these items, but will sometimes be found wielding them.

The stories of the great figures of legend are drawn from barely-remembered histories of past ages. (The orcs often have accurate histories of these personages.)

The cycles of destruction leave ruins in their wakes. Many of the large cities are built on top of the ashes of earlier incarnations of themselves, but many cities are simply abandoned. These abandoned cities are where the ignoble races thrive.

!!! Why do the elves not know this, when the orcs do? Are elves too self-indulgent? Maybe the gnomes always almost-completely destroy the elves, who then need to start over from scratch in a new land.

\page

## Plot Ideas

These are all ideas for where to take the campaign.  They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

The campaign does not need an overarching plot!  I think the players will be content with exploring the world I've created, which I think would be pretty awesome, especially if we want to continue to use this world over time.

### Goblinoid Revolt

The party meets orcs in the Sunless Citadel, learns that they're not the unthinking brutes in Enda that they are on other worlds, and establishes a relationship with them. The leader tells them to visit him in the BoF any time. When they finally take I'm up on it, they come at the worst possible time: just as they are about the rise up.

This will give the players a choice: Side with the Aurelian Empire, side with the orcs of the Bowl of Fire, or sit out the conflict entirely and watch the sides destroy each other.  Each of these options will provide rich storytelling ideas.

In the end, the orcish revolt will earn the Bowl of Fire its freedom from the Aurelian Empire (American Revolution style).

### Overthrowing the Great Golden Dragon

I think the obvious thing for the players to think is that the Great Golden Dragon and the Aurelian Empire need to be overthrown &mdash; it's obviously an affront to the previous Zephyran Empire.

There are many [factions](#factions) that want to see the Great Golden Dragon overthrown.  None of them have a concrete plan, though, they mostly complain about the oppression.  Possibly reuse the great "What has the Aurelian Empire done for us?" scene, where people in the audience reply with, "Protect us from bandits", "Simplified of our economic system", "Brought worship of the gods", and so on.

### Exploration

There are lots of older Zephyran Empire ruins that the Aurelian Empire has decided to ignore.  These include:

- [Old battle sites](#battle-sites)
- Abandoned castles
- Explore the Sea of Fallen Sttars with the Zoon



\page

## Adventure Ideas

### Classic: Against the Cult of the Reptile God

The party travels with the Zoon.  The first port of call is Orlane, a small town on the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Run the [published adventure](#against-the-cult-of-the-reptile-god)

### The Crumbling Tower

A crumbling tower lies not far from the starting town, a remnant from the Great Devastation.  Kids have been playing there since then, but, recently, one of them found an entrace to a previously unknown underground area.  This area leads to a bunch of bodies from the battle that was fought here, including some gear and stuff.

When the party investigates, possibly led by the kids that found the cave, they find that several ***wights*** have taken up residence around the base of the tower.

Once the party defeats the wights and enters the ruins of the tower, they'll find that it is basically a time capsule to 32 years ago: human and dragonborn bodies, who killed each other in battle. No orc bodies here.  Most weapons and the like will be rusted, but there will be a single non-rusted weapon that will turn out to be magical ([Seethe](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ByXYyOVkl7#seethe)).  There will also be 1d4 gemstones that the wights were drawn to.

### Bandit Attack

A wounded commoner on a wildly-running horse comes barrelling into the town. The wounded man is crying about being attacked, right outside the city limits.  He brings the horse right into the common area where the party is finishing up dinner, and the townsfolk swarm to him to help him.  Several dragonborn run off in the direction he came from, presumably to neutralize the threat.

The wounded man describes human bandits, not too far out of town.  This will give the party a chance to either heal the man or follow the dragonborn out to the location of the attack.

- If they follow the dragonborn (or the man's directions) immediately, they'll come across the dragonborn fighting some human bandits.
  - They can either help, in which case the dragonborn will need to have words with them, or
  - Wait until the combat is over -- some of the humans will escape, and the dragonborn will not follow, allowing the party to follow to the bandit's camp.
- If the party decides to follow later, they'll find evidence of a battle on the road, and a DC 15 Survival check will allow them to follow the bandits that escaped to their camp.

The bandit camp will contain 6-8 bandits, 3 of them injured by their scuffle with the dragonborn.  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  If the party defeats them, they'll find a chest containing a 154 gilders and 24 bits, along with enough jerkins and martial weapons (shortswords and battle axes) to outfit a band of 12 humans and their rations and supplies.

### Abandoned Ruins

An old abandoned ruin sits deep in the woods, several days journey from the town.  It is inhabited by ***grung***, who the party encounters gradually over the course of the adventure, which should span several days.

The orcs of the Sunless Citadel direct the party to these ruins because they once housed a great human library containing many books of lore about the Old World.  However, the grung have lived here to hundreds of years and have taken it over, and are viscious combatants.

The ruins should be semi- or mostly-submerged, since the grung are amphibious; this presents problems for the party, since they don't have a way to breath underwater.  The actual library room should be trapped in an area underwater that is sealed in and contains air, or perhaps a whole level at the bottom is filled with air and not water.

##### Todo

- Introduce gilly weed, or ensure they have several stones that let them breath water.

### Overland Travel to a Neighboring City

The party takes a job to transport goods from Squamusport to a neighboring city, overland.  The caravan is ambushed by bandits, who want to steal the goods the party is transporting.  Similar to [Bandit Attack](#bandit-attack).

Once they arrive in the city, play through [Sunless Citadel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/tftyp/a1/the-sunless-citadel).

### Smugglers

The party gets a job making a covert delivery from someone they meet in a tavern, to a neighboring town.  Once they make the delivery, they'll be known by the local [thieves guild](#thieves-guild), who might have work them.

### Great Dragon Skeleton

Everyone knows there are FOUR Great Dragons: Golden, Crimson, Purple, and Ebony.  But what no one knows is that there were actually *five* Great Dragons that emerged from the Sunbloom Mountains.  Potential map: http://www.albinjohnson.com/d&d/resources/maps/04_RacesDragon_shrineof_IO.jpg

The decaying skeleton of the Great Sterling Dragon lies buried deep in the Thundersnow Tundra, just waiting to be found.  But what killed it? What creature or force is strong enough to bring down one of the Great Dragons?

*This should be a later-stage adventure for the party, once they're higher level and know more about the lore.*

### Travel the Sea of Fallen Stars

The party joins the Zoon on their travels across the Sea of Fallen Stars, as guards.  There will be at least one or two pirate battles while they do this.

#### Shipwrecked!

The party gets shipwrecked on a spooky island.

### Gather monster parts

A guild of some sort has commissioned the party to gather certain types of monster or animal parts.

### Haunted Mines

### Maps & Stuff

## Against the Cult of the Reptile God

*Notes on using this module.*

### Location

Orlane is a small farming town a few days travel north of a port city on the Sea of Fallen Stars.

[Decent quality map here](https://i.imgur.com/1DUKCpE.jpg).  Print out a copy and mark it up.  Might need to modify it heavily based on whether ths town is directly on the coast or not.

### Set up / Hook

If the party is trveling with the Zoon, they arrive at a port town where the usually pick up produce, but there is almost nothing to pick up.  Investigation by the Zoon teaches them that the town of Orlane, which is not far and which grows all the produce, has been beset by troubles.  The Zoon leader asks the party to investigate the town to see what has happened.

The Zoon depend heavily on the produce they pick up from this stop -- they not only use it to feed themselves, but they sell much of it as well, which is where they earn much of their money every year.

### Changes to the core assumptions

- Population of Orlane is almost completely Gaian humans, plus the dragonborn.
- The cult has been active for about 6 months.
- The temple of Merikka is a standard Great Dragon temple to Bahamut / Tiamat.
- All the dragonborn in the town are part of the cult, which is part of why everything is so terrible: The usually hands-off guards are more aggressive.
- The clerics are dragonborn, and the cult members in the temple are a mixture of human and dragonborn.




\page

## Battle Sites

- Lots of 32yo old battle sites from the conflict
  - The GGD mostly ignores anything that's not a city, so there are plenty of (picked over) battle sites for the party to find
  - I need to do some research to find out how much a body decomposes in 32 years, so I can accurately represent them.
- The Aurelian Empire didn't clean up any of the battle sites at all
- In one of the first sites they find, have older PCs remember that the [orcs](#orcs) were part of the conflict (DC 15 History), and have all of them try to recognize the orcs (DC 15 Nature, disadvantage for everyone but older PCs).
- These will be a way to get weapons and armor to the party, if they don't have any, but most of the sites will have been very carefully picked over (by orcs and elves, mostly, but don't reveal that).
- Many of these battle sites will be the lair of wights.  The strength of the wights will depend on the strength and size of the party.

## Crazy XXX's

This is a recurring store, with a branch in every major city.  They should provide not only normal goods (adventuring gear) but also, potentially, a black market outlet and maybe other things.

### Features

- Multi-city mail/package delivery (for a cost)
- Disposal of magic items
- Requisition of magic items/artifacts ?
- Banking

\page

## Dieties

### Bahamut

Bahamut is the embodiment of Order, Tradition, and Family, and is usually represented as male.  Bahamut is Lawful Neutral (with Evil tendencies).

### Gruumsh

Gruumsh is the creator god of the orcs.  He is a fierce warrior and a great scholar.  He is almost always represented as a large, beautiful orcish male with one eye and an eyepatch.

Orcish clerics worship Gruumsh exclusively.  His domains are Arcana, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, and War.

### Tiamat

Bahamut is the embodiment of Freedom and Individuality, and is usually represented as female.  Tiamat is Chaotic Good in alignment.

\page

## Dragonborn

The dragonborn of the Great Dragons are different from dragonborn on other D&D worlds.  They are gray in color, with either greenish or silverish irridescent highlights that sparkle in the sun. They are hairless, and their reptilian eyes tend to be yellow and black. They don't have a gender in the typical humanoid sense.

As non-humanoids, they tend to think all humans look alike, which will lead to some confusion and RP fun.  Because of their lack of gender, they will also tend to use incorrect pronouns, referring to everyone as "it" until they are corrected.

Play all dragonborn with the same voice; something like the Vincent D'Onofrio character from Men in Black, gravelly.

*I removed dragonborn as PC races, since based on the evolution of the history of the world, using them as a character race doesn't make ense.*

### Imperial Dragonborn

These dragonborn wear yellow tabards, with black edging and a stylized black drgon on the chest.  Because they're basically reptiles, they don't wear anything else.

\page

## Elves

- Elves need an origin story (low priority)
- Need a name for the forest civilization

### Forest Elves

The forest elves' traditional homeland is an immense forest in the ~~northeast~~ center of Enda.  An elven PC will know where this is.

Elves originated here, in the distant past, with some of them migrating north to the tundra, and others migrating south to live on the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Example elven tree house: http://www.albinjohnson.com/d&d/resources/maps/cov-elftreecity-teuveamanthaar.jpg

### Sea Elves

The sea elves hail from the island of Darkmoon in the Sea of Fallen Stars.  They are excellent sailors and fisherman, and make their living by trading fish and goods with the human cities that sit on the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Their main trading partners are the Zoon, who visit Darkmoon Island several times per season to bring goods and pick up more goods to sell on the sea elves' behalf.

Sea elves have light brown skin, often with a greenish or bluish tint, dark brown hair and brown, blue, or green eyes.  They are standoffish towards people they don't know, but are fiercely loyal to those they consider to be allies or friends.

### Tundra Elves

The tundra elves are wild, but quiet.  Their warriors tend to be monks, and they have many druids among them.

\page

## Factions

There are several organized factions throughout the Empire, though their levels of organization varies quite a bit.  Use [Life of Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian#Political_satire) for inspiration.

Without exception, they consider themselves to be rivals with the other factions, though they all have the same goals and are functionally identical.

### Faction names

- The Zephyran People's Front
- The People's Front of Zephyra
- Campaign for a Free Zephyra
- The Zephyran Emancipation League
- National Association for the Advancement of Zephyran Peoples (NAAZP)

\page

## Geography Notes

- A major crossroads in the middle of the Zephyran Empire
- A mountain range in the center of the continent, very old and sprawling.
  - Chris' character spend ~20 years in these mountains, need to flesh them out

\page

## Goliaths

In many ways, Goliaths fill the role of dwarves on Corrin.


\page

## Imperial Business

### Tax Collectors

*Borrowed from CR, S2 E24*

At the end of every season, a tax collector makes the rounds in their town.  They visit every business and home, where they meet with the owner or head of the household.  They inspect the books, review the standard of living, and estimate the amount of taxes that are owed.  Per the Edict, everyone owes 10% of their income to the Great Golden Dragon.

These visits are also used to check for compliance.  The tax collectors look for objects of platinum, gold, or silver, as well as armor and weapons, and confiscate them if they are present.  If the amount is sufficiently high, the owner/head of household might be punished with labor.

### Buyers of platinum, gold, and silver

The Aurelian Empire has stations that will buy platinum, gold, and silver items, at a value of approximately 1 gilder per 1 gp of value.  They do not ask questions when buying these items.  They will count out the value in gilders, and then immediately remind the seller that 10% of that needs to go to the Great Golden Dragon, and immediately take 10% from the clamps presented.

### Attitude toward external events

The Aurelian soldiers only care about what is specifically happening in the settlements that they are guarding over.  Citizens that travel between cities, by methods other than the approved Imperial caravans, are left to their own devices.  If bandits attack the settlement, they will get involved, but bandits on the road are another story entirely.

### Banks / Safe deposit boxes

The Draconic Shrine in each settlement offer locked strongboxes, protected by Aurelian soliders, where citizens can deposit items.  Every rented strongbox has two locks, both of which need to be unlocked to open the strongbox. The head officiant of the shrine keeps the key to one, and the renter keeps the other.  It's possible to add additional locks to a stronbox as well, if the renter wants to limit access to the strongbox to a *group*, as opposed to an individual.


### Teleportation Circles

The Draconic Shrine in each settlement has a permanent teleportation circle in it.  The empire allows its citizens to use these circles for a flat fee of 50 gilders per entity.  The entity in question must know the rune for the destination circle, however; these work like the Flue network, not the Harper's teleportation network.

\page

## Monsters

The leaking arcane energy that causes sorcerers and magical crystals also wreaks havoc on the natural world.  Several types of creatures exist only because they were animated or mutated by magic.

Need to find or create a replacement race for goblins as a common low-level monster.  I was thinking about using grung, but they're amphibious, so they only make sense around water or in jungles.  I can reskin the goblin stat block with new lore.  Ideally, there would be multiple versions of them, like goblins and hobgoblins, or bokoblins and moblins.

### Dragons and Drakes

True dragons are pretty much non-existant (at least at lower levels), but *drakes* are real, and Uncommon.  A drake is like a dragon from *A Natural History of Dragons*: Animals intelligence, a hunter by instinct, non-magical, and no breath weapon, like a wyvern, guard drake, or ambush drake.

Kobolds are related to drakes, like dragonborn are related to dragons.

#### Young dragons

There are several young dragons throughout the world, offspring of the Great Dragons.  These will have individual names and personalities, and the party might encounter them along the way.  if they do, these should be a Big Fukken Deal, and defeating them is a way to ensure that the party is hated forever.

### Ewoks

A small, furry, bear-looking humanoid, effectively ewoks but definitely not called that, that use the stat block for goblins, except they are humanoids, not goblinoids.

### Grung

Introduce [grung](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/grung) as a common recurring monster type, especially around the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Small-sized amphibious frog humanoids, with druidic and elite variants, in a number of different colors.

### Wights

*[Wight](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rknV3drxm#wight-i-)* is the term used for a generic undead creature.

The magic from the great dragons has permeated into the ground and is causing the dead to rise.  Use the custom zombie monster I created as the basic creature.

\page

## Orcs

- Orcs are a civilized race, but very little is known about them in the former Zephyran Empire.
- Unlike in other settings, orcs are not uncivilized brutes, but instead a race like any other on Enda.
- Orcs have greenish-grey skin, dark hair (black, very dark green, rarely very dark red), dark eyes, are the same size as elves, and have the same lifespans as humans.  They have small fangs protuding from the bottom of their mouths.  Larger fangs are a sign of masculinity, and smaller fangs are a sign of femininity.
- Orcs have a strong affinity for magic.
- They might become available as a PC race.
  - ASIs: Con, Int, Other
  - Orcs are genetically compatible with humans, elves, and goliaths, and are dominant over elves.  Orcish blood gives a natural affinity for magic and a distinctive appearance, and the orcs of the Bowl of Fire are predisposed to be friendly to those with orcish blood.

### Orcish Civilization

- The orcish civilization is in the Bowl of Fire, which is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains.
- The Bowl of Fire was also conquered by the Great Golden Dragon, but the orcs are less accepting of it than the humans of The Zephyran Empipre.
  - Using their Draconic Tokens, the party will be able to visit the Bowl of Fire as citizens of the Aurelian Empire.  This will be their pass into the region.
- Unlike the humanoid races, orcs are very careful record keepers, and are aware of the [Cycle of the Great Dragons](#the-cycle-of-the-great-dragons) and their place in it.
  - This is why the orcs have magic: they remember it from previous cycles.
  - This is also why the players cannot meet orcs at the beginning of the game &mdash; too much could be given away once the party starts talking to them.
- In the Bowl of Fire, orcish clothing varies greatly by season and according to trends.  Robes, vests, and kilts are the norm for males and females, in various dark colors. Scarves and tabards, often handsomely embroidered, are common accessories. Very short hair is currently en vogue among, and orcish males are experimenting with long mustaches.
- Outside the Bowl of Fire, orcs dress as travelers: practical, wearing jerkins or even hauberks.

### The Bowl of Fire

The Bowl of Fire is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains, next to an active volcano (called, ironically, The Slumbering Giant).  There are well-marked paths to the Bowl of Fire from the western edge of the Sunbloom Mountains, though they are not well known to non-orcs.

### Racism

- "Goblins" aren't a thing; "goblin" is a derogatory slang term for orcs, and they get offended by it.
- Zephyrans have ideas about goblins, but they are mostly based on superstition and misinformation.
  - "Goblins are stupid, blood thirsty, and mean"
  - I can definitely use the player's opinion of orcs from their other games as a proxy for their characters' misunderstanding of orcs. :)

### Orcish Runic Magic

Orcs have had a form of runic magic for millenia.  They developed it using the volcanic waters of the Bowl of Fire and the runes of the Giant language.  In order to wield this runic magic, special runes must be tattood on your skin; each rune corresponds to a specific power, and the more powerful the spell, the larger the runes that make it up.

This magical ink is made from certain herbs, flowers, roots, and seeds found only in the Bowl of Fire, which are mashed up and mixed with the volcanic water from the Bowl of Fire.  This ink is then used to permanently carve the runes into the bearers flesh.  When a power is activated, the rune that corresponds to it glows briefly (the Subtle Spell metamagic inhibits this).

[Full details of this sorcerous origin are here](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1BdlK9rlX).

### Orcish involvement in the battles

- Many of the battles involved orcs, dressed in their grey and red uniforms
- The involvement of the orcs in the battles has been downplayed, and is mostly forgotten by the Zephyrans
  - This was intentional by the GGD, to keep humans and orcs from teaming up
- The orcs participated because, unlike the humanoids, they have records of the previous times this happened and know what the outcome will be.

### Orcish Religion

- Should the orcs worship Gruumsh (or a similar diety), with clerics and the like?
- Maybe this is the root of why they are going to revolt: the Great Dragons insist on the worship of Bahamut and Tiamat, and the orcs don't want to give up their existing god(s).
  - This could set up a conflict between the party and the orcs as well.

## Potions of Healing

Because of the limitations on arcane magic, the whole concept of consumable magic items needs to change.  Druids have the knowledge to make many kinds of consumable items, especially healing salves and ointments.

The rules for creating healing potions are presented here.

### Using a salve or ointment of healing

A salve or ointment behaves like a standard healing potion, and comes in the standard varieties.

### Creating a salve or ointment of healing

Crafting healing salves or ointments is a two step process; You must first find fresh ingredients before you can create it.

#### Finding fresh ingredients

Roll a Nature or Survival check.  You have advantage on this roll if you are a ranger in one of your favored terrains, or if you are a Circle of the Land druid in your chosen land.  You cannot be assisted on this roll, though others may also search.  The total amount of ingredients found is aggregated at the end.  Each roll takes 1 hour of game time; individuals can search in parallel, of course.

The DC is determined by the DM, but is usually 15. If you are in a particularly unforgiving environment, like a desert, it might go up to 20.


| Roll | Amount of ingredients
| :--: | :----
|  15  | Enough for one potion
|  20  | Enough for two potions
|  25  | Enough for three potions
|  30  | Enough for four potions

It is possible to spend 1 hour searching for ingredients and still take advantage of a short rest.

#### Creating the potion

In order to create a healing salve or ointment, you must have proficiency with the Medicine skill, and you must have access to an herbalism kit, a fire, and fresh ingredients (less than 24 hours old).  It takes 4 hours to make the potions; at the end, make a Medicine check. If you are proficient with an herbalism kit, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.  You have advantage on the roll if you have the Healer feat or if you are assisted by someone who has proficiency with Medicine.  

The quality of the resulting potion depends on the results of the roll.

| Roll | Effect
| :--: | :-----
|  12  | Non-success, but the ingredients can be reused (see below)
|  15  | *potion of healing*
|  20  | *potion of greater healing*
|  25  | *potion of superior healing*
|  30  | *potion of supreme healing*

On a roll of 11 or less, the ingredients are ruined. If the roll is 12-14, the ingredients can be salvaged, which will take another 2 hours.  At the end of this 2 hours, make another roll, with disadvantage.  A non-success on this roll means the ingredients are ruined.

Salves and ointments created in this way will last a month before losing their potency.

Because creating a salve or ointment of healing takes 4 hours work work, doing so precludes taking a short rest.

## Races

The ignoble Races are degenerate versions of the Noble Races, corrupted  by the magic of the Great Dragons. They are all cruel, vicious, and stupid. They are savage fighters, do not take prisoners, and always fight to the death. They are cannibalistic, preferring their own noble cousins to other humanoids. In combat, they will target their noble cousins preferentially. Occasionally, one of them will develop the ability to harness magic, especially goblins, but this magic is always poorly controlled and unsubtle.

Noble Race | Ignoble Race
:--------- | :-----------
Dragonborn | Kobold
Elf        | Gnome
Goliath    | Dwarf
Human      | Hin (halfling)
Orc        | Goblin

## Rest and Downtime

I need to be flexible with a long rest.  The party should be able to take a long rest during a travel montage, for example, as long as it's fairly low-risk.  Some people recommend making a long rest be 2 or 3 days instead of 7.  Because weeks are 12 days (cycle of Lira), saying "a week" is a long time.

Create a page in the Player's Guide for changes related to resting.  During a long rest, they'll want to have some downtime activities planned out.

One comment recommended ending each session on a long rest boundary, and sending the players home with homework to think about what they're doing during the downtime.

[Downtime Activities are expanded upon in XGtE](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/xgte/downtime-revisited), which should be put somwhere that the players have access to it.

## The Sea of Fallen Stars

- This is becoming a focal point for the party.
- Model it after the Mediterranean Sea, in size and importance.
  - Create a large peninsula in the middle that contains Mount Zephyra.
  - Saltwater, just like the Mediterranean.
- Several of the 11 major Gaian cities will be found on the Sea.
- [The Zoon](#the-zoon) visit all the cities on the Sea regularly.
- There will be a Gibralter-type choke point between the Sea and the Sinarin Ocean, which is where Muldr will be.
  - Create a large statue (or statues) at this point, similar to the statues at the mouth of the Anduin.
    - A statue of the Great Golden Dragon?
- Fed by several major rivers:
  - Attleram River
  - Black River
  - Coral River
- Cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars:
  - Bayonne
  - Lares
  - Mazurek
  - Muldr
  - Orlane (from N1 Against the Cult of the Reptile God)
  - Port of Attleram
  - [Squamusport](#squamusport), on the Coral River delta
  - Salinas
- Islands in the Sea of Fallen Stars:
  - Darkmoon
    - Home of the seafaring elves
- Other things in the Sea
  - A Bermuda Triangle-type area
  - A mysterious area of the sea that is always encased in fog
    - It contains a temple to an old, forgotten god
  - 
- Grung are common on the southern shore of the Sea.

## Squamusport

<!--

Squamusport sits at the delta of the Coral River, and is where the barge city of the Zoon starts its yearly journey upriver toward Mount Zephyra.  The barge city carries goods from all the port cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars to the capital, and protecting it an excellent way for new mercenaries to earn some name recognition, for the journey is often perilous.

-->

Squamusport is a bustling port city that straddles the Coral River Delta, in the northwest of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  [The Zoon](#the-zoon) make a stop here near the beginning of every season as part of their quarterly cycle.  The Coral River runs almost directly north/south where it meets the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Squamusport is built on top of the Coral River like a giant X:  The center of the city straddles it, and contains the ***Common*** (the city's common area), which is fully enclosed to protect against the elements.  The other wards of the city radiate off this central common area: The ***East Side*** to the northeast (businesses and official buildings, including the dragonborn barracks); The ***West Side***, to the northwest (residential); the ***East Docks***, to the southeast and the ***West Docks*** to southwest.

These wards are distributed across two levels.  The Docks (both East and West) are colloqially called ***Sealevel***, while the Common, the East Side, and the West Side are colloquially called ***Toplevel***.

The Toplevel consists of a series of large, raised wooden platforms on thick stilts.  There are several levels of platforms, connected by wooden staircases of varying and inconsistent slope and size.

To the southeast and southwest of the Common are large, rough-hewn wooden staircases that descend down about ~80 feet to the East Dock and West Dock, respectively.  The docks themselves line the river, and go under the wards of the Toplevel.

All the buildings of Squamusport are on the Toplevel: Official buildings, shops, taverns, the Common, and the residential areas.  Taverns tend to be on the bottom two legs, towards the docks, and the official buildings and shrine are in the Eest Side.

The main feature of the Sealevel is the docks.  Ships come in at all times of the day and night, and there are always workers about waiting to be hired to load and unload ships.  There are a few taverns in the area, but no living quarters or shops, and it is heavily patrolled by dragonborn soldiers at all hours.

Because the Toplevel is elevated, there is a lot of land under it; this land is squishy and wet, and floods with the tides.  Nevertheless, children and criminals spend a lot of time down here, and there will be at least one cave system here.

The primary business of the city is trade, but there are some farmers on the last to the west of the city.  To the east of the city is a large open plain, and when the party meets here for the first time it will be occupied by an Eshen caravan.

> - ***West Docks:*** Docks for outgoing ships (toward the Sea)

### The Docks

The area where the East Docks and West Docks are is an exceptionally deep part of the river, excavated by hand many centuries ago and maintained during the middle of the summer every year.

There are a few taverns on the docks, but they are forbidden from boarding guests, so they are all little more than a kitchen, a pantry, and a bar.  There are many free-standing tables, chairs, and outhouses on the Docks so that the workers don't need to return Toplevel while they take a break.

### The Zoon

When the Zoon visit Squamusport, they don't head up the river; their barge is too large to fit.  Instead, they tether the barge to the southeast of the city, where there is setup a permanent dock area that goes unused most of the year.  (Other ships that dock there find themselves aggressively ignored until they pull into the East Dock.)

It is unusual for an Eshen caravan to be outside Squamusport at the same time that the Zoon are docked there, but that will be the occasion when session 1 starts.  Thus, the parties thrown by the caravan will be even rowdier than usual, as the Zoon join them.  There will be a friendly competition to see who can "out-party" the other.

## Sunless Citadel

### History, background, and general features

- Oakhurst is a generic Zephyran village.
- The citadel is about a day's journey outside the village. It's been there for as long as anyone can remember, almost everyone knows about it, and almost everyone ignores it.
  - Every once in a while, some fool-hardy youths decide they're going to explore it.  This happened just recently, in fact: An explorer &mdash; an old man who carried his sword in broad defiance of the Aurelian Empire &mdash; convinced 3 of the village young adults to join his crazy quest to explore the legendary citadel.
- The citadel is actually a remnant from a Dragon Cult that flourished about 500 years ago. The citadel collapsed due to an unstable foundation, but that was far outside of living memory.
- ***Skip the nonsense with the Gulthias Tree's fruit.***
- If the party is paying attention, they might question why they are finding gilders in a place that is waaaay more than 32 years old.  Don't offer an answer.

#### The Orcs and Kobolds of the Sunless Citadel

The orcs of the Sunless Citadel have been living here for about 4 years.  They left hte Bowl of Fire when the oppression of the Great Golden Dragon and the dragonborn soldiers became too much for them to bear.  They were a radical minority when they left, as most orcs found the Great Golden Dragon's rule to be tolerable.  They traveled west for months until they found the Citadel, and decided to settle here.  Not long after they settled, the kobolds moved in, and they immediately started to clash, which led to the current situation.  Neither the orcs not the kobolds knew about Balak and the Gulthias Tree when they settled, and were too settled in by the time they realied how fucked their situation actually was.

### Inside the citadel

- All the Draconic writing uses the Elvish alphabet, as usual &mdash; this is a thing that the Great Dragons have always done, even in their prior empires.
- Most of the Perception checks should actually be Investigation checks.

#### Entry (areas 4 - 5)

All references to *goblins* should be *kobolds* instead.

#### Lower Section (areas 6 - 12)

These areas are mostly unchanged.

##### Area 12

The Treasure is modified as follows:
- The *ceremonial dagger* is actually **[Hatred's Bite](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ByXYyOVkl7#hatred-s-bite)**.
- The silver rings and amulet will be wanted by the Great Gold Dragon
- 140 gilders
- 1d4 gemstones.  Let the players roll for them.

#### Kobold Quarters (Areas 13 - 25)

##### Area 14

The keg contains 2 arcane gemstones.

##### Area 15

Calcryx is not actually a dragon, but is instead a **drake** (use the [white guard drake stats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/white-guard-drake)).

##### Area 18

The room contains a single orcs, not 4 goblins (goblins aren't a thing).  Just like all orcs, this orc is intelligent, and speaks to the party in Zephyran, asking for his freedom.

##### Area 21

Yusdrayl's cache contains 2d4 doses of a *potion of healing* and 35 gilders in a clamp.

##### Area 23

Block off access to the Underdark.

#### Orc Quarters (Areas 25-41)

The orcish areas of the citadel are marked different from the kobold areas (and from how they're described in the adventure, as well):  They are clean and organized, and  do not smell.

Be sure to present these areas as the living quarters of civilized folks that are down on their luck, not semi-intelligent rabble.

##### Area 27

3 gemtones

##### Area 31

The orc guards here will try to speak to the party before attacking, unless the party attacks first.  If they are accompanied by kobolds, all interactions are made at disadvantage.

##### Area 34

Erky Timbers is --

##### Area 36

Each of these areas contains an orcish veteran, armed with a longsword and longbow.  These veterans are responsible for defending the settlement as necessary.

##### Area 40

The orc home base.  The area is divided into a large number of well-constructed but makeshift bunk beds, and there is a small library in the southwest corner of the room not far from area 36.

##### Area 41

Durnn is a mid-level orcish sorcerer, and Grenl is a mid-level druid.  Together, they run the orcish settlement, and oversee all the day to day operations.  They are not happy with their tribe's current situation, but they have been living here since the situation in the Bowl of Fire got worse, about 4 years ago.

## Trainable Skills

Some skills get better the more you use them.  During an adventure, mark each time a character makes a successful roll on a trainable skill.  When a character gains a level, have them roll a d100; if the number is less than or equal to the number of cumulative successes for that trainable skill, they gain proficiency in that skill.  If the check is not successful, keep the current count, so they can retry next level.  Once a character gains proficiency in a trainable skill, there is  no reason to keep tracking successes.

| Skill           | Ability      | Trainable?
| : ------------- | :----------- | :--:
| Acrobatics      | Dexterity    | Yes
| Animal Handling | Wisdom       | Yes
| Arcana          | Intelligence | No
| Athletics       | Strength     | Yes
| Deception       | Charisma     | Yes
| History         | Intelligence | No
| Insight         | Wisdom       | Yes
| Intimidation    | Charisma     | Yes
| Investigation   | Intelligence | Yes
| Medicine        | Wisdom       | No*
| Nature          | Intelligence | No
| Perception      | Wisdom       | Yes
| Performance     | Charisma     | Yes
| Persuasion      | Charisma     | Yes
| Religion        | Intelligence | No
| Sleight of Hand | Dexterity    | Yes
| Stealth         | Dexterity    | Yes
| Survival        | Wisdom       | Yes

## Thieves Guilds

- Every settlement should have a thieves guild.
- Should there be an Empire-wide overarching guild, like the Mafia, or a small guild in every town?
- I like the idea of a faction of thieves.

## XP

I am thinking of giving out XP instead of using milestone leveling.  While this will be more work for me, it will allow me to reward individual players.

Keep XP private at first, in case I want to switch to milestone.

#### Individual Actions

For each character, track the following things using ticks.  At the end of each session, add them up and award XP.  Unless otherwise noted, each of these is worth 10 xp per instance.  This is in addition to XP gained for killing monsters.

[Input from Reddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/8sktl4/what_noncombat_things_do_you_award_xp_for/).

#### Combat

- Landing the killing blow on a monster (melee only)
- Critical hit
- Going unconscious during a fight (you can still learn from failure)
- Clever battle strategy

#### Skills and class features

- Successful skill rolls
- Unsuccessful skill rolls (you can still learn from failure)
  - This does not include Perception or Investigation checks to just look around, and does not include passive checks.
  - Need to think on this more.
- Using a class feature
- Casting a spell
  - This might happen too often, so would give spellcasters an advantage over martials
- Creating a healing potion

#### RP

- Making an ally
- Good roleplaying

#### Items

- Identifying an arcane gemstone
- Attuning to an arcane gemstone
- Finding artifacts (including named weapons or armor)

#### Meta

These are things that the *players* can do to earn XP for their characters.

- Providing a recap of the last session
- Retrieving information from their notes

### Lore / Story Progress

Group awards are worth 100 xp to each character that was present at the session.

- Befriending the Zoon
- Befriending the orcs
- Visiting a new location
- Seeing one of the Great Dragons for the first time
- Discovering the true nature of the dragons and the reason they emerge from the Sunbloom Mountains

### Tracking XP

Create a [table](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SkggVU6Zm#character-progression) containing the following fields:

- Player name
- Character name
- XP (aggregated)
- Number of sessions

Before each session, create a tracking sheet containing the character name and a column for each of the things that they can earn XP for.

At the end of each session, add up the XP earned for the session and email it to the player directly.

\page

## The Zoon

The Zoon were originally from Esh.  When Esh was destroyed, they left, like all the others, but took to living on the Sea of Fallen Stars.

- The leader of the Zoon is an older human bard named Hagbard Celine. (We'll see if anyone gets the reference.)
- They have a few bards, but are mostly sailors, fisherman, merchants, and soldiers.
- They are known for their honesty and their ability to see through lies.  All Zoon are proficient in Insight, and all NPC Zoon bards will have Expertise in it.
- They are thought to be very wealthy, but no one knows for sure.
  - They are, but they don't keep most of their wealth on their barges.  They have a series of money laundering/shells set up throughout the Confederacy.

### The Barge City

The barge city is named ***Morzaduun***, although this is generally forgotten.  Most people just call it "The Zoon's City", or something similar.  The name *Zoon* comes from a contraction of the name of the city.

Morzaduun consists of three huge barges roped together.

- The first is the living area, and has a central wide, enclosed room. Hagbard splits his days between this area and walking the barges.
- The second is the living area, which is a tent city where the Zoon sleep.  There is a single shared tent where all the hired mercenaries sleep and keep their stuff.
- The third is an open barge where the goods they are transporting are stored.  This third barge has high walls, and is patrolled by guards.
  - These guards are a mix between Zoon veterans and hired mercenaries.
  - The Zoon veterans specialize in archery, and are proficient in Perception and Investigation.

#### Life on the barge city

If the players end up traveling with the Zoon, they are expected to perform guard duties; the Zoon do not take passengers, only workers.  The work involves primarily standing guard over the goods being transported, and watching for bandits.

### Transrorters of Goods

- They make their living by transporting goods among the cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
- They are able to do this because of their impeccable reputation for honesty.
- When they take goods for delivery, they require that the goods are locked using a lock that they do not have the key for, and won't take anything that is unlocked.
  - They then add an additional lock to the item, the key to which only the bargemaster holds.  This helps ensure that the items are unmolested during the trip.
  - This limits the size of the things they can take.
  - They require a description of the party they are to drop the goods with, but offer no insurance beyond that.  This description can include a code word or similar.
- The cost to transport goods is based on the number of items, and must be paid in advance.  A small chest costs 50 gilders, and a large chest costs 500 gilders.
  - The don't do volume discounts as a rule, but can be haggled with.
  - They don't offer insurance policies as a rule, either.
  
### PC Zoon

If one of the PCs wants to be Eshen and come from the Zoon, this is acceptable.  This will give them a strong contact with the Zoon, which means they'll definitely be able to secure transportation for themselves and the party without problem.

A Zoon PC will have access to the bard class, which will be fun.
