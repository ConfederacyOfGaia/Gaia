# A DM's Guide to the Zephyrlands

This guide is a supplement to the [Player's Guide to the Age of the Great Dragons](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/By7LYLm1Rz), providing additional details, context, mechanics, and lore.  Some of the lore and mechanics will be propagated to the Player's Guide once it is discovered (e.g., orcs).


## The Cycle of the Great Dragons

The current ***Age of the Great Dragons*** is just the latest cycle in a saga that has been ongoing for thousands of years.  Once a millenia, dragons emerge from their native home deep in the Sunbloom Mountains, conquer the lands, and have offspring.  They conquer the lands so that they are under control when the young emerge, and are not endangered.  The parent dragons then die of old age, and their offspring rule for 500 years and then return to hibernation for 500 years.  During the dragons' rule, most of the humanoids are killed off, and their civilization slowly rebuilds itself after the dragons return to hibernation, which is why they are still relatively technologically non-advanced.  During each cycle, magic returns to the land, and great sorcerers arise and create works of wonder and great power, but they inevitably die off during the resulting extinctions.

All the magical weapons and artifacts that exist are created during the first few decades of the dragons' emergence, after the conquer the humanoids but before they are genocided.

## Plot Ideas

These are all ideas for where to take the campaign.  They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

### Goblinoid Revolt

The party meets orcs in the Sunless Citadel, learns that they're not the unthinking brutes in Enda that they are on other worlds, and establishes a relationship with them. The leader tells them to visit him in the BoF any time. When they finally take I'm up on it, they come at the worst possible time: just as they are about the rise up.

This will give the players a choice: Side with the Aurelian Empire, side with the orcs of the Bowl of Fire, or sit out the conflict entirely and watch the sides destroy each other.

In the end, the orcish revolt will earn the Bowl of Fire its freedom from the Aurelian Empire (American Revolution style).

### Overthrowing the Great Golden Dragon

I think the obvious thing for the players to think is that the Great Golden Dragon, and the Aurelian Empire, need to be overthrown &mdash; it's obviously an affront to the previous Zephyran Empire.

There are many [factions](#factions) that want to see the Great Golden Dragon overthrown.  None of them have a concrete plan, though, they mostly complain about the oppression.  Possibly reuse the great "What has the Aurelian Empire done for us?" scene, where people in the audience reply with, "Protect us from bandits", "Simplified of our economic system", "Brought worship of the gods", and so on.

### Exploration

There are lots of older Zephyran Empire ruins that the Aurelian Empire has decided to ignore.  These include:

- [Old battle sites](#battle-sites)
- Abandoned castles


\page

## Adventure Ideas


### The Crumbling Tower

A crumbling tower lies not far from the starting town, a remnant from the Great Devastation.  Kids have been playing there since then, but, recently, one of them found an entrace to a previously unknown underground area.  This area leads to a bunch of bodies from the battle that was fought here, including some gear and stuff.

When the party investigates, possibly led by the kids that found the cave, they find that several ***wights*** have taken up residence around the base of the tower.

Once the party defeats the wights and enters the ruins of the tower, they'll find that it is basically a time capsule to 32 years ago: human and dragonborn bodies, who killed each other in battle. No orc bodies here.  Most weapons and the like will be rusted, but there will be a single non-rusted weapon that will turn out to be magical ([Seethe](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ByXYyOVkl7#seethe)).  There will also be 1d4 gemstones that the wights were drawn to.

### Bandit Attack

A wounded commoner on a wildly-running horse comes barrelling into the town. The wounded man is crying about being attacked, right outside the city limits.  He brings the horse right into the common area where the party is finishing up dinner, and the townsfolk swarm to him to help him.  Several dragonborn run off in the direction he came from, presumably to neutralize the threat.

The wounded man describes human bandits, not too far out of town.  This will give the party a chance to either heal the man or follow the dragonborn out to the location of the attack.

- If they follow the dragonborn (or the man's directions) immediately, they'll come across the dragonborn fighting some human bandits.
  - They can either help, in which case the dragonborn will need to have words with them, or
  - Wait until the combat is over -- some of the humans will escape, and the dragonborn will not follow, allowing the party to follow to the bandit's camp.
- If the party decides to follow later, they'll find evidence of a battle on the road, and a DC 15 Survival check will allow them to follow the bandits that escaped to their camp.

The bandit camp will contain 6-8 bandits, 3 of them injured by their scuffle with the dragonborn.  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  If the party defeats them, they'll find a chest containing a 54 gilders and 24 bits, along with enough jerkins and martial weapons to outfit a band of 12 humans and their rations and supplies.

### Abandoned Ruins

An old abandoned ruin sits deep in the woods, several days journey from the town.  It is inhabited by ***grung***, who the party encounters gradually over the course of the adventure, which should span several days.

The orcs of the Sunless Citadel direct the party to these ruins because they once housed a great human library containing many books of lore about the Old World.  However, the grung have lived here to hundreds of years and have taken it over, and are viscious combatants.

The ruins should be semi- or mostly-submerged, since the grung are amphibious; this presents problems for the party, since they don't have a way to breath underwater.  The actual library room should be trapped in an area underwater that is sealed in and contains air, or perhaps a whole level at the bottom is filled with air and not water.

##### Todo

- Introduce gilly weed, or ensure they have several stones that let them breath water.

### Overland Travel to a Neighboring City

The party takes a job to transport goods from Squamusport to a neighboring city, overland.  The caravan is ambushed by bandits, who want to steal the goods the party is transporting.  Similar to [Bandit Attack](#bandit-attack).

### Smugglers

The party gets a job making a covert delivery from someone they meet in a tavern, to a neighboring town.  Once they make the delivery, they'll be known by the local [thieves guild](#thieves-guild), who might have work them.

### Great Dragon Skeleton

Everyone knows there are FOUR Great Dragons: Golden, Crimson, Purple, and Ebony.  But what no one knows is that there were actually *five* Great Dragons that emerged from the Sunbloom Mountains.

The decaying skeleton of the Great Sterling Dragon lies buried deep in the Thundersnow Tundra, just waiting to be found.  But what killed it? What creature or force is strong enough to bring down one of the Great Dragons?

*This should be a later-stage adventure for the party, once they're higher level and know more about the lore.*

### Travel the Sea of Fallen Stars

The party joins the Zoon on their travels across the Sea of Fallen Stars.

*I actually don't like this; not carrying travelers with them gives the Zoon credibility, and I think I'd prefer that the party encounter the Zoon in several different places along their route, instead of simply ride with them.  This lets them be a recurring set piece.*

### Gather monster parts

A guild of some sort has commissioned the party to gather certain types of monster or animal parts.

### Haunted Mines

### Maps & Stuff

\page

## Battle Sites

- Lots of 32yo old battle sites from the conflict
  - The GGD mostly ignores anything that's not a city, so there are plenty of (picked over) battle sites for the party to find
  - I need to do some research to find out how much a body decomposes in 32 years, so I can accurately represent them.
- The Aurelian Empire didn't clean up any of the battle sites at all
- In the first site they find, have Chris' old PC remember that the [orcs](#orcs) were part of the conflict (DC 15 History), and have all of them try to recognize the orcs (DC 15 Nature, disadvantage for everyone but Chris).
- These will be a way to get weapons and armor to the party, if they don't have any, but most of the sites will have been very carefully picked over (by orcs and elves, mostly, but don't reveal that).
- Many of these battle sites will be the lair of wights.  The strength of the wights will depend on the strength and size of the party.

Need to translate this into a Real Calendar

## Dragonborn

The dragonborn of the Great Dragons are different from dragonborn on other D&D worlds.  They are gray in color, with either greenish or silverish irridescent highlights that sparkle in the sun. They are hairless, and their reptilian eyes tend to be yellow and black. They don't have a gender in the typical humanoid sense.

As non-humanoids, they tend to think all humans look alike, which will lead to some confusion and RP fun.  Because of their lack of gender, they will also tend to use incorrect pronouns, referring to everyone as "it" until they are corrected.

Play all dragonborn with the same voice; something like the Vincent D'Onofrio character from Men in Black, gravelly.  


\page

## Elves

- Elves need an origin story

\page

## Factions

There are several organized factions throughout the Empire, though their levels of organization varies quite a bit.  Use [Life of Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian#Political_satire) for inspiration.

Without exception, they consider themselves to be rivals with the other factions, though they all have the same goals and are functionally identical.

### Faction names

- The Zephyran People's Front
- The People's Front of Zephyra
- Campaign for a Free Zephyra
- The Zephyran Emancipation League
- National Association for the Advancement of Zephyran Peoples (NAAZP)

\page

## Goliaths

\page

## Monsters

The leaking arcane energy that causes sorcerers and magical crystals also wreaks havoc on the natural world.  Several types of creatures exist only because they were animated or mutated by magic.

### Dragons and Drakes

True dragons are pretty much non-existant (at least at lower levels), but *drakes* are real, and Uncommon.  A drake is like a dragon from *A Natural History of Dragons*: Animals intelligence, a hunter by instinct, non-magical, and no breath weapon, like a wyvern, guard drake, or ambush drake.

Kobolds are related to drakes, like dragonborn are related to dragons.

### Grung

Introduce [grung](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/grung) as a common recurring monster type.  Small-sized frog humanoids, with druidic and barbarian variants, in a number of different colors.

### Wights

***[Wight](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rknV3drxm#wight-i-)*** is the term used for a generic undead creature.

The magic from the great dragons has permeated into the ground and is causing the dead to rise.  Use the custom zombie monster I created as the basic creature. But how to keep this from getting too boring?

- They find these zombies in caves or other lowered places (underground) &mdash; closer to the source of magic
- The party discovers a clue to why they are rising.
  - Tie this into the dead Great Sterling Dragon?
    - This being the source of all magic would be cool - its death is what unleashed the magic into the world.


\page

## Naming Conventions

### Cities, Towns, and Villages

#### Suffixes

- -ford = on a river
- -gard = at a crossroads
- -ham = small settlement
- -mouth = on a delta
- -port = on a river where it meets the sea

#### Location names

- When possible, name settlements after the feature they're near.
  - Fenwood Village is near the Fenwoods (a forest).
  - Tabinthford is the village on the Tabinth River
- Name a settlement after its founder
  - XXX Village

### Geological Features

- -mere = lake
- -mont = mountain

\page

## Orcs

- Orcs are a civilized race, but very little is known about them in the former Zephyran Empire.
- Unlike in other settings, orcs are not uncivilized brutes, but instead a race like any other on Enda.
- Orcs have greenish-grey skin, dark hair (black, very dark green, rarely very dark red), dark eyes, are the same size as elves, and have the same lifespans as humans.  They have small fangs protuding from the bottom of their mouths.  Larger fangs are a sign of masculinity, and smaller fangs are a sign of femininity.
- Orcs have a strong affinity for magic, though [their magic](#orcish-runic-magic) predates the arcane magic of the Great Dragons.
- They might become available as a PC race.
  - ASIs: Con, Int, Other
  - Orcs are genetically compatible with humans, elves, and goliaths, and are dominant over elves.  Orcish blood gives a natural affinity for magic and a distinctive appearance, and the orcs of the Bowl of Fire are predisposed to be friendly to those with orcish blood.

### Orcish Civilization

- The orcish civilization is in the Bowl of Fire, which is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains.
- The Bowl of Fire was also conquered by the Great Golden Dragon, but the orcs are less accepting of it than the humans of The Zephyran Empipre.
  - Using their Draconic Tokens, the party will be able to visit the Bowl of Fire as citizens of the Aurelian Empire.  This will be their pass into the region.
- Unlike the humanoid races, orcs are very careful record keepers, and are aware of the [Cycle of the Great Dragons](#the-cycle-of-the-great-dragons) and their place in it.
  - This is why the orcs have magic: they remember it from previous cycles.
  - This is also why the players cannot meet orcs at the beginning of the game &mdash; too much could be given away once the party starts talking to them.

### The Bowl of Fire

The Bowl of Fire is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains, next to an active volcano (ironically, called The Slumbering Giant).

### Racism

- "Goblins" aren't a thing; "goblin" is a derogatory slang term for orcs, and they get offended by it.
- Zephyrans have ideas about goblins, but they are mostly based on superstition and misinformation.
  - "Goblins are stupid, blood thirsty, and mean"
  - I can definitely use the player's opinion of orcs from their other games as a proxy for their characters' misunderstanding of orcs. :)

### Orcish Runic Magic

Orcs have had a form of runic magic for millenia.  They developed it using the volcanic waters of the Bowl of Fire and the runes of the Giant language.  In order to wield this runic magic, special runes must be tattood on your skin; each rune corresponds to a specific power, and the more powerful the spell, the larger the runes that make it up.

This magical ink is made from certain herbs, flowers, roots, and seeds found only in the Bowl of Fire, which are mashed up and mixed with the volcanic water from the Bowl of Fire.  This ink is then used to permanently carve the runes into the bearers flesh.  When a power is activated, the rune that corresponds to it glows briefly (the Subtle Spell metamagic inhibits this).

[Full details of this sorcerous origin are here](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1BdlK9rlX).

### Orcish involvement in the battles

- Many of the battles involved orcs, dressed in their grey and red uniforms
- The involvement of the orcs in the battles has been downplayed, and is mostly forgotten by the Zephyrans
  - This was intentional by the GGD, to keep humans and orcs from teaming up
- The orcs participated because, unlike the humanoids, they have records of the previous times this happened and know what the outcome will be.

### Orcish Religion

- Should the orcs worship Gruumsh (or a similar diety), with clerics and the like?
- Maybe this is the root of why they are going to revolt: the Great Dragons insist on the worship of Bahamut and Tiamat, and the orcs don't want to give up their existing god(s).
  - This could set up a conflict between the party and the orcs as well.


\page

## The Sea of Fallen Stars

- This is becoming a focal point for the party.
- Model it after the Mediterranean Sea, in size and importance.
  - Create a large peninsula in the middle that contains Mount Zephyra.
- Several of the 11 major Gaian cities will be found on the Sea.
- [The Zoon](#the-zoon) visit all the cities on the Sea regularly.
- There will be a Gibralter-type choke point between the Sea and the Sinarin Ocean, which is where Muldr will be.
  - Create a large statue (or statues) at this point, similar to the statues at the mouth of the Anduin.
- Fed by several major rivers:
  - Attleram River
  - Black River
- Cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars:
  - Muldr
  - Port of Attleram
  - Bayonne
  - Squamusport
  - Salinas
  - Lares
  - Mazurek
- Islands in the Sea of Fallen Stars:
  - Darkmoon
    - Home of the seafaring elves



\page

## Sunless Citadel

\page


## Thieves Guilds

- Every settlement should have a thieves guild.
- Should there be an Empire-wide overarching guild, like the Mafia, or a small guild in every town?
- I like the idea of a faction of thieves.


\page

## The Zoon

The Zoon were originally from Eshen.  When Esh was destroyed, they left, like all the others, but took to living on the Sea of Fallen Stars.

- The leader of the Zoon is an older human (bard) named Hagbard Celine. (We'll see if anyone gets the reference.)
- They have a few bards, but are mostly sailors, fisherman, merchants, and soldiers.
- They are known for their honesty and their ability to see through lies.  All Zoon are proficient in Insight, and all Zoon bards will have Expertise in it.
- They are thought to be very wealthy, but no one knows for sure.
  - They are, but they don't keep most of their wealth on their barges.  They have a series of money laundering/shells set up throughout the Confederacy.

### The Barge City

The barge city seeds a name.

The barge city consists of three huge barges roped together.

- The first is the living area, and has a central wide, enclosed room. Hagbard splits his days between this area and walking the barges.
- The second is the family area, which is a tent city where the Zoon sleep.
- The third is an open barge where the goods they are transporting are stored.  This third barge has high walls, and is patrolled by Zoon warriors.
  - These warriors are Champion fighters who specialize in archery, and are proficient in Perception and Investigation.
- Is there a fourth barge that is for transporting people or animals?

### Transrorters of Goods

- They make their living by transporting goods among the cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
- They are able to do this because of their impeccable reputation.
- The way they keep their reputation is by not allowing non-Zoon to travel with them, thereby ensuring that the goods they transport are free from tampering.
  - Possible side quest: Getting the Zoon to trust the party.
- When they take goods for delivery, they require that the goods are locked using a lock that they do not have the key for, and won't take anything that is unlocked.
  - They then add an additional lock to the item, the key to which only the bargemaster holds.  This helps ensure that the items are unmolested during the trip.
  - This limits the size of the things they can take.
  - They require a description of the party they are to drop the goods with, but offer no insurance beyond that.  This description can include a code word or similar.
- The cost to transport goods is based on the number of items, and must be paid in advance.  A small chest costs 50 gilders, and a large chest costs 500 gilders.
  - The don't do volume discounts as a rule, but can be haggled with.
  - They don't offer insurance policies as a rule, either.
