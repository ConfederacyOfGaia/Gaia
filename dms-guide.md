# A DM's Guide to the Zephyrlands


## Battle Sites

- Lots of 32yo old battle sites from the conflict
  - The GGD mostly ignores anything that's not a city, so there are plenty of (picked over) battle sites for the party to find
- The Aurelian Empire didn't clean up any of the battle sites at all
- In the first site they find, have Chris' old PC remember that the orcs were part of the conflict (DC 15 History), and have all of them try to recognize the orcs (DC 15 Nature, disadvantage for everyone but Chris)

## Orcs

- Orcs are a civilized race
- "Goblins" aren't a thing; "goblin" is a slang term for orcs
- Many of the battles involved orcs, dressed in their grey and red uniforms
- The involvement of the orcs in the battles has been downplayed, and is mostly forgotten by the Zephyrans
  - This was intentional by the GGD, to keep humans and orcs from teaming up
