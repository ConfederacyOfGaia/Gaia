# A DM's Guide to the Zephyrlands

Notes for populating the Zephyrlands.  These notes are organized alphabetically



\page

## Battle Sites

- Lots of 32yo old battle sites from the conflict
  - The GGD mostly ignores anything that's not a city, so there are plenty of (picked over) battle sites for the party to find
  - I need to do some research to find out how much a body decomposes in 32 years, so I can accurately represent them.
- The Aurelian Empire didn't clean up any of the battle sites at all
- In the first site they find, have Chris' old PC remember that the orcs were part of the conflict (DC 15 History), and have all of them try to recognize the orcs (DC 15 Nature, disadvantage for everyone but Chris)
- These will be a way to get weapons and armor to the party, if they don't have any, but the sites will have been very carefully picked over by orcs.
- The first battle site they find will be a tower in the center, mostly untouched by the battle.  It will turn out to be haunted by ***draugr***, which will be the party's first run in with them.

## Monsters

The leaking arcane energy that causes sorcerers and magical crystals also wreaks havoc on the natural world.  Several types of creatures exist only because they were animated or mutated by magic.

### Draugr

***Draugr*** is a privisional term used for a generic undead creature.  Their power will range from CR 1/4 zombies to magic-wielding CR 14.

Draugr look like a recently killed body: swollen, blackened, and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut: red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.

More powerful draugr will have the ability to *enlarge* themselves at will. Enlarged draugr will have a separate stat block showcasing its increased abilities.

##### TODO

- I need to make a more setting-neutral name for these creatures
- Never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.

## Orcs

- Orcs are a civilized race, but very little is known about them by the former Zephyran Empire.
- Unlike in other settings, orcs are not uncivilized brutes, but instead a race like any other on Enda.
- Orcs have grey skin, dark hair, and dark eyes, are the same size as humans, and have the same lifespans.
- Orcs have a strong affinity for magic, though [their magic](#orcish-runic-magic) predates the arcane magic of the Great Dragons.
- They might become available as a PC race.
  - ASIs: Con, Int, Other
  - Orcs are genetically compatible with humans, elves, and goliaths, and are dominant over elves.  Orcish blood gives a natural affinity for magic and a distinctive appearance, and the orcs of the Bowl of Fire are predisposed to be friendly to those with orcish blood.
- The Orcish civilization is in the Bowl of Fire, which is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains.
- "Goblins" aren't a thing; "goblin" is a derogatory slang term for orcs, and they get offended by it.
- Zephyrans have ideas about goblins, but they are mostly based on superstition and misinformation.
  - "Goblins are stupid, blood thirsty, and mean"

### Orcish Runic Magic

Orcs have had a form of runic magic for centuries.  They developed it using the volcanic waters of the Bowl of Fire and the runes of the Giant language.  In order to wield this runic magic, special runes must be tattood on your skin; each rune corresponds to a specific power, and the more powerful the spell, the larger the runes that make it up.

This magical ink is made from certain herbs, flowers, roots, and seeds found only in the Bowl of Fire, which are mashed up and mixed with the volcanic water from the Bowl of Fire.  This ink is then used to permanently carve the runes into the bearers flesh.  When a power is activated, the rune that corresponds to it glows briefly (the Subtle Spell metamagic inhibits this).

[Full details of this sorcerous origin are here](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1BdlK9rlX).

### Orcish involvement in the Great Devastation

- Many of the battles involved orcs, dressed in their grey and red uniforms
- The involvement of the orcs in the battles has been downplayed, and is mostly forgotten by the Zephyrans
  - This was intentional by the GGD, to keep humans and orcs from teaming up


\page

## The Sea of Fallen Stars

- This is becoming a focal point for the party.
- Model it after the Mediterranean Sea, in size and importance.
  - Create a large peninsula in the middle that contains Mount Zephyra.
- Several of the 11 major Gaian cities will be found on the Sea.
- The Zoon visit all the cities on the Sea regularly.
- There will be a Gibralter-type choke point between the Sea and the Sinarin Ocean, which is where Muldr will be.
  - Create a large statue (or statues) at this point, similar to the statues at the mouth of the Anduin.



\page

## The Zoon

The Zoon were originally from Eshen.  When Esh was destroyed, they left, like all the others, but took to living on the Sea of Fallen Stars.

- The leader of the Zoon is an older human (bard) named Hagbard Celine. (We'll see if anyone gets the reference.)
- The barge city consists of three huge barges roped together.
  - The first is the living area, and has a central wide, enclosed room
  - The second is the family area, which is a tent city where the Zoon sleep.
  - The third is an open barge where the goods they are transporting are stored.  This third barge has high walls, and is patrolled by Zoon warriors.
    - These warriors are Champion fighters who specialize in archery.
- The Zoon have a few bards, but are mostly sailors and fisherman.
- The Zoon are thought to be very wealthy, but no one knows for sure.
- They make their living by transporting goods among the cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
  - They are able to do this because of their impeccable reputation.
  - The way they keep their reputation is by not allowing non-Zoon to travel with them, thereby ensuring that the goods they transport are free from tampering.
    - Possible side quest: Getting the Zoon to trust the party.
  - When they take goods for delivery, they require that the goods are locked using a lock that they do not have the key for, and won't take anything that is unlocked.
    - They then add an additional lock to the item, the key to which only the bargemaster holds.  This helps ensure that the items are unmolested during the trip.
    - This limits the size of the things they can take.
    - They require a description of the party they are to drop the goods with, but offer no insurance beyond that.  This description can include a code word or similar.
  - The cost to transport goods is based on the amount.  A small chest costs 50 gilders, and a large chest costs 500 gilders.
    - The don't do volume discounts as a rule, but can be haggled with.
    - They don't offer insurance policies as a rule, either.
