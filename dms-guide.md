# A DM's Guide to the Zephyrlands

Notes for populating the Zephyrlands, organized alphabetically.


## Plot Ideas

These are all ideas for where to take the campaign.  They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

### Goblinoid Revolt

Once the party meets some orcs and learns that they're not the unthinking brutes in Enda that they are on other worlds, and establishes a relationship with them, they will hear that the orcs are going to revolt against the Great Golden Dragon.

This will give the players a choice: Side with the Aurelian Empire, side with the orcs of the Bowl of Fire, or sit out the conflict entirely and watch the sides destroy each other.

In the end, the orcish revolt will earn the Bowl of Fire its freedom from the Aurelian Empire (American Revolution style).

### Overthrowing the Great Golden Dragon

I think the obvious thing for the players to think is that the Great Golden Dragon, and the Aurelian Empire, need to be overthrown &mdash; it's obviously an affront to the previous Zephyran Empire.

There are many [factions](#factions) that want to see the Great Golden Dragon overthrown.  None of them have a concrete plan, though, they mostly complain about the oppression.  Possibly reuse the great "What has the Aurelian Empire done for us?" scene, where people in the audience reply with, "Protect us from bandits", "Simplified of our economic system", "Brought worship of the gods", and so on.

### Exploration

There are lots of older Zephyran Empire ruins that the Aurelian Empire has decided to ignore.  These include

- Old battle sites
- Abandoned castles
- There are 11 known cities in the Zephyran Empire (now the Confederacy of Gaia).  Maybe there *used* to be 12, and one of them is "lost"?
  - The Lost 12th City thing is very similar to the Lost Great Dragon, so only do one or the other. 


### Great Dragon Skeleton

Everyone knows there are FOUR Great Dragons: Golden, Crimson, Purple, and Ebony.  But what no one knows is that there were actually *five* Great Dragons that emerged from the Sunbloom Mountains.

The decaying skeleton of the Great Sterling Dragon lies buried deep in the Thundersnow Tundra, just waiting to be found.  But what killed it? What creature or force is strong enough to bring down one of the Great Dragons?


\page

## Battle Sites

- Lots of 32yo old battle sites from the conflict
  - The GGD mostly ignores anything that's not a city, so there are plenty of (picked over) battle sites for the party to find
  - I need to do some research to find out how much a body decomposes in 32 years, so I can accurately represent them.
- The Aurelian Empire didn't clean up any of the battle sites at all
- In the first site they find, have Chris' old PC remember that the [orcs](#orcs) were part of the conflict (DC 15 History), and have all of them try to recognize the orcs (DC 15 Nature, disadvantage for everyone but Chris).
- These will be a way to get weapons and armor to the party, if they don't have any, but most of the sites will have been very carefully picked over (by orcs and elves, mostly, but don't reveal that).
- The first battle site they find will be a tower in the center, mostly untouched by the battle.  It will turn out to be haunted by ***wights***, which will be the party's first run-in with them.


\page

## Factions

There are several organized factions throughout the Empire, though their levels of organization varies quite a bit.  Use [Life of Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian#Political_satire) for inspiration.

Without exception, they consider themselves to be rivals with the other factions, though they all have the same goals and are functionally identical.

### Faction names

- The Zephyran People's Front
- The People's Front of Zephyra
- Campaign for a Free Zephyra
- The Zephyran Emancipation League
- National Association for the Advancement of Zephyran Peoples (NAAZP)


\page

## Monsters

The leaking arcane energy that causes sorcerers and magical crystals also wreaks havoc on the natural world.  Several types of creatures exist only because they were animated or mutated by magic.

### Wights

***Wight*** is the term used for a generic undead creature.  Their power will range from a slow-moving CR 1/4 to magic-wielding CR 14.

A wight looks like a recently killed body: swollen, blackened, and generally hideous to look at, and bearing the unmistakable stench of death and decay.  They bleed when cut: red blood and black bile that spurts forth.  They exist either to guard their treasure from life, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life.


##### TODO

- Never mention their name directly, until the party learns from someone more knowledgable what they are.

\page

## Naming Conventions

### Cities, Towns, and Villages

#### Suffixes

- -ford = on a river
- -gard = at a crossroads
- -ham = small settlement
- -mouth = on a delta
- -port = on a river where it meets the sea

#### Location names

- When possible, name settlements after the feature they're near.
  - Fenwood Village is near the Fenwoods (a forest).
  - Tabinthford is the village on the Tabinth River
- Name a settlement after its founder
  - XXX Village

### Geological Features

- -mere = lake
- -mont = mountain

\page

## Orcs

- Orcs are a civilized race, but very little is known about them in the former Zephyran Empire.
- Unlike in other settings, orcs are not uncivilized brutes, but instead a race like any other on Enda.
- Orcs have greenish-grey skin, dark hair (black, very dark green, rarely very dark red), dark eyes, are the same size as elves, and have the same lifespans as humans.  They have small fangs protuding from the bottom of their mouths.  Larger fangs are a sign of masculinity, and smaller fangs are a sign of femininity.
- Orcs have a strong affinity for magic, though [their magic](#orcish-runic-magic) predates the arcane magic of the Great Dragons.
- They might become available as a PC race.
  - ASIs: Con, Int, Other
  - Orcs are genetically compatible with humans, elves, and goliaths, and are dominant over elves.  Orcish blood gives a natural affinity for magic and a distinctive appearance, and the orcs of the Bowl of Fire are predisposed to be friendly to those with orcish blood.

### Orcish Civilization

- The orcish civilization is in the Bowl of Fire, which is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains.
- The Bowl of Fire was also conquered by the Great Golden Dragon, but the orcs are less accepting of it than the humans of The Zephyran Empipre.
  - Using their Draconic Tokens, the party will be able to visit the Bowl of Fire as citizens of the Aurelian Empire.  This will be their pass into the region.

### The Bowl of Fire

The Bowl of Fire is a huge valley in the Sunbloom Mountains, next to an active volcano (ironically, called The Slumbering Giant).

### Racism

- "Goblins" aren't a thing; "goblin" is a derogatory slang term for orcs, and they get offended by it.
- Zephyrans have ideas about goblins, but they are mostly based on superstition and misinformation.
  - "Goblins are stupid, blood thirsty, and mean"
  - I can definitely use the player's opinion of orcs from their other games as a proxy for their characters' misunderstanding of orcs. :)

### Orcish Runic Magic

Orcs have had a form of runic magic for centuries.  They developed it using the volcanic waters of the Bowl of Fire and the runes of the Giant language.  In order to wield this runic magic, special runes must be tattood on your skin; each rune corresponds to a specific power, and the more powerful the spell, the larger the runes that make it up.

This magical ink is made from certain herbs, flowers, roots, and seeds found only in the Bowl of Fire, which are mashed up and mixed with the volcanic water from the Bowl of Fire.  This ink is then used to permanently carve the runes into the bearers flesh.  When a power is activated, the rune that corresponds to it glows briefly (the Subtle Spell metamagic inhibits this).

[Full details of this sorcerous origin are here](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1BdlK9rlX).

### Orcish involvement in the Great Devastation

- Many of the battles involved orcs, dressed in their grey and red uniforms
- The involvement of the orcs in the battles has been downplayed, and is mostly forgotten by the Zephyrans
  - This was intentional by the GGD, to keep humans and orcs from teaming up


\page

## The Sea of Fallen Stars

- This is becoming a focal point for the party.
- Model it after the Mediterranean Sea, in size and importance.
  - Create a large peninsula in the middle that contains Mount Zephyra.
- Several of the 11 major Gaian cities will be found on the Sea.
- The Zoon visit all the cities on the Sea regularly.
- There will be a Gibralter-type choke point between the Sea and the Sinarin Ocean, which is where Muldr will be.
  - Create a large statue (or statues) at this point, similar to the statues at the mouth of the Anduin.
- Fed by several major rivers:
  - Attleram River
  - Black River
- Cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars:
  - Muldr
  - Port of Attleram

\page

## Thieves Guilds

- Every settlement should have a thieves guild.
- Should there be an Empire-wide overarching guild, like the Mafia, or a small guild in every town?
- I like the idea of a faction of thieves.


\page

## The Zoon

The Zoon were originally from Eshen.  When Esh was destroyed, they left, like all the others, but took to living on the Sea of Fallen Stars.

- The leader of the Zoon is an older human (bard) named Hagbard Celine. (We'll see if anyone gets the reference.)

- They have a few bards, but are mostly soldiers, sailors, and fisherman.
- They are known for their honesty and their ability to see through lies.  All Zoon are proficient in Insight, and all bards will have Expertise in it.
- They are thought to be very wealthy, but no one knows for sure.
  - They are, but they don't keep most of their wealth on their barges.  They have a series of money laundering/shells set up throughout the Confederacy.

### The Barge City

The barge city seeds a name.

The barge city consists of three huge barges roped together.
- The first is the living area, and has a central wide, enclosed room. Hagbard splits his days between this area and walking the barges.
- The second is the family area, which is a tent city where the Zoon sleep.
- The third is an open barge where the goods they are transporting are stored.  This third barge has high walls, and is patrolled by Zoon warriors.
  - These warriors are Champion fighters who specialize in archery, and are proficient in Perception and Investigation.

### Transrorters of Goods

- They make their living by transporting goods among the cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
- They are able to do this because of their impeccable reputation.
- The way they keep their reputation is by not allowing non-Zoon to travel with them, thereby ensuring that the goods they transport are free from tampering.
  - Possible side quest: Getting the Zoon to trust the party.
- When they take goods for delivery, they require that the goods are locked using a lock that they do not have the key for, and won't take anything that is unlocked.
  - They then add an additional lock to the item, the key to which only the bargemaster holds.  This helps ensure that the items are unmolested during the trip.
  - This limits the size of the things they can take.
  - They require a description of the party they are to drop the goods with, but offer no insurance beyond that.  This description can include a code word or similar.
- The cost to transport goods is based on the number of items, and must be paid in advance.  A small chest costs 50 gilders, and a large chest costs 500 gilders.
  - The don't do volume discounts as a rule, but can be haggled with.
  - They don't offer insurance policies as a rule, either.
