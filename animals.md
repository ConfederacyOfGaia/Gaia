From the [Earthsea Wikia](http://earthsea.wikia.com/wiki/Otak):

> It is said that the rare creature eats only mice and small insects, and in appearance is small and furry. [Ged](http://earthsea.wikia.com/wiki/Ged) himself has a familiar Otak when on [Roke](http://earthsea.wikia.com/wiki/Roke). They are thought to be little, aggressive pets with bad tempers. It was an unusual occurrance for Ged's Otak to trust him, because wild Otaks tend not to stay around humans, but avoid them. Because of the rarity of these little creatures, they are only known to inhabit four islands in the Earthsea Archipelago. Those islands are Roke, Ensmer, Pody and Wathort.
>
> Because the creatures named Otaks are relatively small, they can easily be caught and overpowered. They are not usually known as human, or wizard, lovers, but it is also unknown whether they are caught and eaten by them too. If one was to guess, they could be prey to dragons, but it is unlikely because of their small size.

> ## Kylven Dogsteed

The Kylven dogsteed is a large, strong canine species, large enough for a gnome to ride but too small for an elf.  Dogsteeds are the preferred steed of gnomes throughout Gaia.

Dogsteeds are more intelligent than other common mounts, and will form a strong bond with the gnome who own them.  If a gnome spends at least 2 weeks training with a particular dogsteed, they form a bond that is very difficult to break, unless the gnome abuses the animal or one of its kin.  A gnome will rarely bond with multiple dogsteeds at once, though the animals will allow it as long as they know each other.  A dogsteed is highly protective of its gnome toward dogsteeds it doesn't know, and will fight to defend its bonded gnome.

___
> ## Kylven Wardog


The Kylven Wardog is a large canine that has been bred by Kylven breeders for centuries.  It is a large, intelligent dog, related to the Kylven Dogsteed, but bred for strength and ferocity and trained for combat.

# Pigasus

*"Oh they taste great once you get the bloody furnace hot enough, crispy spicy hell-boar bacon. If only those thrice damned pigs weren't so resistant to fire... What? Of course they're safe to eat, quit your belly-aching, and get back on those bellows."*

*- Jarvok, Half-Orc, Half-Dwarf, Chef-barian.*

##### [When Pigs Fly](https://www.reddit.com/r/monsteraday/comments/6c5hpo/day_60_pigasus/)


There are many breeds of Pigasi. Hell-Boar Pigasi have been corrupted and bred for their aggressive nature, their strong tusks and their skills as durable flying mounts. Teacup Pigasi have been carefully bred over the years to serve as familiars to spellcasters

A Hellboar Pigasus has thick dark reddish brown hide and yellowing tusks, yellow eyes and jet black feathered wings. A Teacup Pigasus has light pink skin, white wings and large blue eyes.
