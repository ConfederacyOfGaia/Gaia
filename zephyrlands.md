# The Zephyrlands - Player's Guide

## Overview

*The Zephyrlands* refers to the western half of the continent, and it consists of several indepedent kingdoms.  All of the Zephyrlands were once united in a single vast empire, but that empire fell to Orcish invaders a hundred years ago.

Our story begins in one of these: a large confederacy of autonomous provinces, collectively called *The Confederacy of Gaia* by the inhabitants.  The overall culture of the confederacy has a vaguely 18th-century Japan feel to it; most people are farmers, ranchers, and herders, and live simple, rural lives in tune with the rhythms of the land and organized around the seasons.

## History

From time immemorial, Zephyrans lived peacefully on their land, and developed an advanced civilization.  Then, a hundred years ago, a wave of devastation crashed over the land:  Orcs came from the mountains in the east, crushing everything in their path, driving the gnomes of the eastern hills towards the sea, and toppling the Zephyran empire.  The orcs destroyed the great cities and, leaving broken masonry and burnt husks in their path.

The Zephyrans slowly rebuilt from those ashes, and coalesced into several kingdoms:  Vella, Kylf, and the Confederacy of Gaia.  In the decades since the Great Devastation, these kingdoms have enjoyed a cautious peace, interspersed with border skirmishes, land disputes, and the occasional goblinoid raid.  The gnomish refugees made their homes in kingdoms, mainly Gaia and Kylf, and have been an integral part of the fabric of Zephyran life.  The orcs have not returned, but the kingdoms live in fear of the day they do.

The after effects of the Great Devastation are still felt everywhere, from the ruins of cities to the yearly Rememberence Day that every town and village maintains, commemorating the day they were overrun by the orc horde.

## Geography

The Zephyrlands cover a vast amount of land.  They are bordered on the west by an ocean, to the north by frozen, inhospitible tundra, to the east by immense, craggy mountains, and to the south by endless desert.  There a smaller mountain range that runs through the center of the continent to the sea, and an inland sea in north central.

Distances in the Zephyrlands are measured in *wheels*: 1 wheel is the distance a horse-drawn wagon can travel in a day, and is roughly 20 Earth miles.  From north to south, the Zephyrlands measure about 50 wheels (1000 miles), and 25 from East to West (500 miles).

## Culture

Zephyran culture centers around nature, and the rhythms of day to day life are bound up with the seasons, the harvests, and the moon. These patterns are woven into everyday life.

The kingdoms are generally on good terms with each other, and trade and travel between them is very common.  Most inhabitants strongly identify with their town or village, rather than The Zephyrlands as a whole.  Every village maintains an active militia, composed of the human and gnomish adults of the village, that trains every week on the day before market day.

Families tend to be large, and will live on the same plots of land for generations.  Among farmers, ranchers, and herders, which are exclusively humans, the first born children will usually take over their parents' farm or ranch when they reach middle adulthood (about 30 years old), at which point the parents will mostly retire as honored elders.  The other children will work on the family farms as well, although some will leave home and set up their own homestead or become craftsmen.  There is work on the ranches and farms for children of all ages, starting with the very young, so all children learn their parents' line of work.

Artisans, craftsmen, and merchants make up the middle classes, which, in Gaia and Kylf, consist of both gnomes and humans. They tend to follow the same basic pattern as farmers and ranchers, though the families are smaller:  The children are expected to apprentice to the parent's craft and take it over when they are adults, although artisans and craftsmen will usually work later into their middle age than farmers.  Gnomes dislike farming and ranching, and make excellent and clever artisans and craftsmen.

### Regional Cultures

#### The Confederacy of Gaia

The Zephyran Empire originated in Gaia, and much of Gaian has percolated out to (or been inflicted upon) the other kingdoms.  For this reason, Gaian culture is the most "generic" of all the kingdoms, and the other kingdoms' cultures will usually be detailed by how they differ from Gaian culture.

Gaia has had a strong gnominsh influence since the Great Devastation, which has altered its cultural landscape beyond its Zephyran days.  


#### Kylf

Kylven life centers around horses and ranching.  Children grow up riding horses and most families own ranches.  Common pasttimes are dressage, polo, and horse racing, which Kylvens take very seriously.

Kylf produces the best horses in the Zephyrlands, of which the kingdom is jutifiably proud.  Their military consists of mounted knights and mounted archers (both of these are available as fighter archetypes for characters from Kylf).

##### Notes

* Take some cultural bits from Rohan, if relevant

#### Vella

##### Notes

* Barbarians from the north.
  * The barbarian class might makes sense here.  Their rage is reserved for the traditional enemies (see below).
* Use the peoples of Siberian and northern Mongolia as models
* Vellans cities are always built on easily-defended mesas.
* Also great horsemen, like Kylf, although with a different focus:  Instead of raising horses for sale and profit, Vellan horses are treated like members of the family.  A Vellen horse (need a name for it) is smaller, stronger, and more intelligent than a Kylven horse, and fircely loyal to its master (i.e., unsellable).  They live directly in their owners' homes.
* Vella doesn't have druids, it has *shamans*.  Vellans worship a single god that manifests as a giant polar bear, and provides game and holds back the snows.
  * As a result, they consider polar bears to be sacred.
* Vellans have a traditional enemy: A race of intelligent lizard people (yuan-ti?  troglodites?  lizalfos?), who come from even farther north (the Thundersnow tundra).
* Vellans have their own language, and most don't speak Zephyran.  Though they were technically part of the Zephyran empire, not much changed for them when they were conquered or when the empire fell.
* Vellans trade with the gaians to their South and/or Kylvens to their east, depending on which part of Vella they live.


#### Genouj

##### Notes

* Similar to Gerudo
* Matriarchal society
* Males are treated as slaves
  * There is a small male breeding class (not playable as PCs) and complex rules around bloodlines to prevent interbreeding.
* Genoujian females are the same physical size and weight as males from other cultures.
* Genouj is famous for its druids and fighters; very few rangers or mages.

### Gnomish Culture

#### Notes

* Get away from the Gnomish stereotypes here; no tinkers, no unpronouncable names, nothing like that.  Gnomes are serious craftsmen, amazing scholars, and clever inventors, with a strong tradition of arcane magic, although they do not have any particular affinity for spells of the illusion school.
* Gnomish males and females are physically indistinguishable, unless they are naked.  They are the same general size and weight, and both have beards.  As a result, gnomes tend to be very relaxed about gender and sex roles, and homosexual pair bonding is as common as heterosexual pair bonding.
  * Since it is close to impossible for non-gnomes to distinguish male gnomes from female gnomes, many humans and elves adventure with their gnomish friends for years without knowing whether they are male or female.  Also, it is considered rude to ask a gnome, because their culture does not distinguish gender roles.
  * Gnomish names give no indication of its owner's gender.
  * It is acceptable for a player to simply not list their gender on their character sheet.
* Gnomes do not have any kind of small animal affinity.
* Since they gnomes fled their homelands in the Great Devastation, gnomish druids are very rare.  They simply don't yet feel the right connection to their new lands.  Before the Great Devastation, gnomish druids were common, and very powerful.
* There was a well-known (and semi-secret) school of arcane magic in the gnomish homeland, which was completely razed by the orcs during the Great Devastation.  The gnomish mages that escaped have not yet recreated it, however, because of all the knowledge that was lost.

## Provinces, Towns, Villages, and Outposts

Villages are the main urban unit, and they are scattered around the confederacy, clustering near geographical features like rivers and major crossroads.  A town is simply a large village:  It will have more resources available to players, and a much larger exurban population.  The largest towns tend to be composed of several smaller towns that have congealed into a single urban mass.

Each town or village has the things the players will expect: a general store, an inn, maybe a few other stores, a common house (inn, tavern, and stables), and local government offices.  A larger town might have multiple of each.  Most villages have a weekly market (daily for towns) where local farmers send their harvests or goods to sell.  There will also be other buildings, shops, houses, and so on.

The commoners live in farm houses proximal to their home villages, with their farmlands, pastures, and orchards surrounding their homes.  Artisans, craftsmen, and merchants will usually live in the village or town directly.

In addition to towns and villages, there are outposts scattered around the confederacy, similar to stables in Breath of the Wild.  An outpost usually only has an inn (including a stable), and sometimes a small general store.  They all fall on trade routes and frequently traveled roads, and rely on a steady stream of merchants, transporters, and travelers for both their goods and income.  These provide a safe place for the PCs to take long rests and recuperate, and occasionally use as a home base.  They will also be a good place for the PCs to meet up with NPCs, such as merchants or other travelers.

Travel between villages is often dangerous: bandits have been known to prey on defenseless travelers and rich caravans.  Because gaians rely so heavily on inter-village trade, finding work as a caravan guard is a good way for the young and strong to earn some money and establish their reputation.

Despite the heavy reliance on inter-village trade, most gaians haven't traveled more than a few days away from their home village.  They are often very interested in news from the outside world, and will listen to stories from anyone willing to share them.  They especially like when elves visit, because they always bring news and stories from distant villages.

Zephyran homes tend to be short, squat, and wide, with low ceilings and wraparound porches, and gently-slanted roofs.  Building materials depend on the resources in the area, but wood is the most common.  Every house has a fireplace in it, as the focal point of the household life.  Beds tend to be wide and low, sometimes sitting directly on the floor or ground, and it's not uncommon for children to sleep bunched together.  Zephyran farms and ranches are often collections of buildings, connected by shared roofs.

## Demographics

The towns and villages of The Zephyrlands are peopled by humans and gnomes.  The gnomes were driven from their traditional home in the eastern mountains during the Great Devastation, and have fully integrated into the human villages.  Elves from the north travel freely throughout the confederacy, though they seldom settle in the villages and towns.

> Based on [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6bab39/how_many_heroes_are_there_bottom_up_worldbuilding/), integrate the demographics numbers from http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/demog.htm, especially the parts about population densities, town/village sizes, and so on.  A calculator built using this data is [here](http://qzil.com/kingdom/).

## Politics

Each town and village has both a mayor, elected by the local villagers.  The local constabularies tend to be very small and composed of career officers, and typically reports to a police chief, who himself reports to the mayor.  The police chief doubles as the head of the militia, though by tradition only the mayor can declare war.

There will always be at least one government building in a village: The mayor's office, the military commander's office, the chief constable's office, and a few jail cells.  In small or even medium sized villages, these might just separate desks in a one-room building, although in most large villages, the constabulary will have their own building for the jails.

## Religion

Reverence for nature plays a major part in lives of Zephyrans, though there are no formal deities, observances, or ceremonies.  Zephyrans celebrate the new and full moons and the changing of the seasons with feast days.  The entire world is imbued with the power of nature, and some zephyrans are able to spontaneously draw on this power to change the world around them; these people are called druids, and some of them are quite powerful.  Because there are no formal religious ceremonies or dogmas, these druids don't necessarily hold positions of power or influence, though they are respected.

The closest a village will have to a holy day is their Rememberence Day, which every village has, and which differs for every village.  This day commemorates the day the orc hordes descended on their village during the Great Devastation, and is a day of solemn reflection and gratitude.  All work ceases on these days, and if they fall on a market day or a training day, the activities are just skipped and resumed the following week.

## Languages and Writing

The people of the confederacy all speak a common language, called Zephyran.  In general, only merchants, travelers, and mages are literate, though all commoners can do enough math to buy and sell their goods.  If a character can read and write, that should be noted on their sheet along with the languages they speak.

The gnomish language is mostly integrated into Zephyran, especially the words for magic, crafts, and technology, at which gnomes excel.  There are a few pockets in larger cities where the gnomish community is large enough to preserve the language.

The elves have their own language, with a complex literary and poetic tradition.  Very few humans or gnomes know how to speak it, but most elves can speak Zephyran.

## Currency

The standard unit of currency in the confederacy is the gilder, a small, lumpy gold coin about the size of a flattened blueberry with a hole in the center. There are also marks and bits, which have the same size and shape as a gilder but are made of silver and copper, respectively, and correspond to 1/10 and 1/100 of a gilder.  Gilders are usually strung together on a piece of twine with a clasp, called a clamp, rather than kept loose in a purse.  These clamps are sometimes worn as jewelry, especially as long necklaces or bracelets, to discourage pickpockets. Clamps are so-named because of the clever fasteners they employ, which allow quick access to the strung gilders.  About 5 or 6 gilders will fit on an inch of twine, so carrying or storing large amounts of money can get bulky quickly.

Gemstones are also common; they are not used as currency, but as decorative elements, and can be traded or sold to craftsmen or artificers for components.

## Calendar and Time

The calendar is broken up into 4 seasons, and each season is broken up into 3 28-day lunar months.  The seasons change on the solstices and equinoxes, and the full moon is always on the 7th day of the month and the new moon is always on the 21st day of the month.  There are major feast days for each change of season, and minor feast days for each full moon and new moon.  Time is expressed as "X days (before|after) the Yth (full|new) moon [in the Z season]"; for example: "3 days after the 3rd full moon of the winter" means March 24th, and "6 days before the 2nd new moon on spring" means May 1st.

### Important Dates

* When the Zephyran Empire was founded
* The Great Devastation



## Combat

Life in the villages and towns is relatively safe, but once you venture beyond those limits, things tends to get more interesting and dangerous.  Martial weapons are uncommon and difficult to get in villages, but are easy to get in larger towns.  Adventurers, caravan guards, and the like will carry martial weapons, but the militias use mostly simple weapons like spears, short bows, daggers, and clubs.

In many of the larger towns, especially ones that see a lot of travelers, martial weapons such as swords are required to be tied closed with a special red ribbon, provided at the entrance to the town.  This signifies that the bearer has come in peace.

## Monsters

Kobold bandits are a recurring problem for the villages in the Goldenwood area.  Kobolds are small, degenerate, dog-faced humanoids, and always attack in swarms.  Luckily, they are weak and cowardly and can be defeated with a few well-placed explosives or fireballs.  They have been known to attack caravans and villages alike.

Some of the more remote villages are occasionally attacked by gnolls. Human-sized, hyena-headed, and destructive, gnolls pose a much larger threat to the villages than kobolds, but luckily are much more rare.

Rangers, Scouts, and other explorers occasionally stumble upon ogres deep in the woods.  These stupid creatures will savagely attack humans on sight, so it's best to simply avoid them whenever possible.

## Animals

The Zephyrlands have the usual wild animal species, but also has a number of animals that don't exist in our world, including the otak (from Earthsea) and the torro (a small, intelligent monkey).  Both of these species are not particularly dangerous, and will mainly appear in the action as familiars or because the players have martial arts experience.

## Magic

The land, and nature, is imbued with a subtle magic.  Low-level magic is common, but extravagant magic is almost unheard of.  Some people develop and affinity for nature, and learn some simple nature magics; a few of these people become druids.  Much less common are mages, who learn to manipulate the arcane forces of the universe into the effects they desire, using the force of their will alone.  Where druids work in harmony with nature, mages are often contrary to nature; for this reason, druids are often suspicious toward, or occasionally downright hostile to, mages.

Low-powered magic items are common, especially those that can be produced by druids, like potions and salves.  For example, it's possible to buy potions of healing from an artificer or merchant for as low as 10 gilders, and druids learn to brew potions early in their career.

## Magic System

Magic in Gaia is based on a points system, as outlined in chapter 9 of the DMG.  All of a character's spent spell points are recovered after a long rest, and half of their expended points are recovered after a short rest.  It is rumored that there are some potions that can increase a caster's spell points beyond their normal max, but, in general, this total cannot be increased except through experience.  If a character is reduced to 0 spell points, they are mentally fatigued, and need to rest; until they do, all ability checks involving their spell casting attribute are made at a disadvantage.

In addition to the spell points outlined in the table in the class section, a character gains additional spell points at each level based on the bonus for their primary attribute (Intelligence for mages, Wisdom for druids).  If a character's primary attribute changes, they gain or lose spell points retroactively, similar to hit points.

Casting a spell as a higher level works exactly as outlined in the PHB: the caster pays the increased point cost and gets the increased effect, so magic missile cast as a 3rd-level spell costs 6 points instead of 2.

### Cantrips and non-spellcasting classes

A non-spellcaster can gain cantrips by taking the Druid Cantrip Feat.  About a quarter of the general population can tap into the magic of nature in this way; we can assume that all PCs have this ability, unless they explicitly don't want it.  The overall attitude towards this widespread ability is similar to the attitude of Xanthians towards talents.

### Magic Items

There are several common magic items that can be purchased from tinkers and merchants, like potions of healing, rings of protection, enchanted arrows, and clothes with special properties.  The prices for these items will vary greatly, based on availability and rarity of the item.

### Commissioning Magic Items
Along with commodity magical items, the PCs can commission more powerful or uncommon magical items directly.  The cost of these items will tend to be high, both in terms of gilders and other resources.

The process for commissioning a new magical item will usually begin with the players speaking with the artificer (or their apprentice) to find out the cost and material requirements, leaving a hefty down payment (non-refundable, of course), adventuring to find or buy the components, delivering them to the artificer, and then waiting while the artificer creates the enchantment.  Depending on the PCs' relationship with the artificer, full payment might be required with delivery of the materials, as opposed to at the final pickup time.
