# A Player's Guide To The Zephyrlands

## Overview

*The Zephyrlands* refers to the western half of the continent *Enda* of a world called *Corrin*, and it consists of several indepedent kingdoms.  The kingdoms of the Zephyrlands were once united in a single vast empire, but that empire was destroyed Orcish invaders 50 years ago.

Our story begins in one of these kingdoms: a large confederacy of autonomous cities and villages, collectively called *The Confederacy of Gaia* by the inhabitants.  The overall culture of the confederacy has a vaguely 18th-century Japan feel to it; most people are farmers, ranchers, and herders, and live simple, rural lives in tune with the rhythms of the land and organized around the seasons.

## History

From time immemorial, humans lived peacefully on the temperate lands of western Enda, and eventually developed an advanced civilization.  500 years ago, the great mage Augustine Gloomrend, called The Zephyr, conquered the kingdoms between the Sunbloom Mountains in the east and the Sinaran Ocean in the west, and, for 450 years, his family ruled *The Zephyrlands*, as they called it.  The *Zephyran Emperors* ruled fairly, coorperating with the gnomish and elvish kingdoms and allowing their vassals to mostly govern themselves.  They installed in their empire a veneration for nature, the cycle of the world mirrored the seasons, and *Zephyrans* lived close to the land.

Then, 50 years ago, the *Great Devastation* crashed over the land:  Orcs came from the Sunbloom Mountains, crushing everything in their path, driving the gnomes of the eastern hills towards the sea, and toppling the Zephyran empire.  The orcs destroyed the great cities, leaving broken masonry and burnt husks in their path, and slaughtered the imperial families.

The Zephyrans slowly rebuilt from those ashes, and coalesced into several kingdoms:  Kylf, Muldr, Vella, and the Confederacy of Gaia.  In the decades since the Great Devastation, these kingdoms have enjoyed a cautious peace, interspersed with border skirmishes, land disputes, and the occasional goblinoid raid.  The gnomes never returned to their homelands; they settled throughout Gaia and Kylf, and have been an integral part of the fabric of Zephyran life.

Before the Great Devastation, magic was plentiful and mages were powerful and respected, but, for reasons unknown, the orcs targetting the institutions of magical learning, leaving the Zephyrlands bereft of thousands of years of magical lore and knowledge.

The after effects of the Great Devastation are still felt everywhere, from the ruins of cities to the yearly Rememberence Days that every town and village maintains, commemorating the day they were overrun by the orc horde.

## Geography

The Zephyrlands cover a vast amount of land.  They are bordered on the west by a vast ocean, to the north by frozen, inhospitible tundra, to the east by immense, craggy mountains, and to the south by endless desert.  There a smaller mountain range that runs through the center of the continent to the sea, and an inland sea in north central.  See the [map](map.md) for more exact details and dimensions.

Distances in the Zephyrlands are measured in *wheels*: 1 wheel is defined as the distance a horse-drawn wagon can travel in a day, and is roughly 20 Earth miles.  From north to south, the Zephyrlands measure about 45 wheels (about 900 miles), and 40 from East to West (about 800 miles).  On the [map](map.md), each hex represents 1 wheel, and thus about 1 day's travel.

## Cultures

The Zephyrlands currently consists of several kingdoms, but until the Great Devastation, they were all part of the same Zephyran empire. This means they share a culture and a common language, flavored with the regional differences that are left over from the pre-imperal kingdoms. After the Great Devastation, the kingdoms mostly reverted to their old boundaries, but kept many of the Zephyran conventions and culture.

The peoples of the continent are collectively called Zephyrans. Peoples from individual kingdoms speak their own lanaguages, and also speak the common tongue (also called Zephyran).  Most people strongly identify with their home town or village, rather than their kingdom or the Zephyrlands as a whole.

In general, Zephyran culture centers around nature, and the rhythms of day to day life are bound up with the seasons, the harvests, and the moon. These patterns are woven into everyday life, and influence most things.

### Regional Cultures

#### The Confederacy of Gaia

**The Confederacy of Gaia** occupies the temperate belt that runs through the center of the continent. The heart of the Zephyran Empire was in Gaia, and the language, culture, and traditions of Gaia are what the empire spread to its vassals.  For this reason, Gaian culture is the most "generic" of all the kingdoms, and the other kingdoms' cultures will usually be detailed by how they differ from Gaian culture.  

The population of Gaia consists of humans and gnomes. During the Great Devastation, when the orcs came down from the mountains, they ravaged the Onoklat Hills with fire and acid, and drove the gnomes out; Gaians now call them the Soothills, as nothing grows there, and the gnomes left forever and integrated into the human societies that would take them. Gaia absorbed the majority of the gnomes (though many settled in Kylf as well), and Gaian culture now carries the unmistakable signs of gnomish influence.

\page

Gaian families tend to be large, and will live on the same plots of land for generations.  Among farmers, ranchers, and herders, which are exclusively humans, the first born children will usually take over their parents' farm or ranch when they reach middle adulthood (about 30 years old), at which point the parents will mostly retire as honored elders.  The other children will work on the family farms as well, although some will leave home and set up their own homestead or become craftsmen.  There is work on the ranches and farms for children of all ages, starting with the very young, so all children learn their parents' line of work.

Artisans, craftsmen, and merchants make up the middle classes, which consist of both gnomes and humans. They tend to follow the same basic pattern as farmers and ranchers, though the families are smaller:  The children are expected to apprentice to the parent's craft and take it over when they are adults, although artisans and craftsmen will usually work later into their middle age than farmers.  Gnomes dislike farming and ranching, and make excellent and clever artisans and craftsmen.

Almost every village maintains an active militia, composed of the human and gnomish adults of the village, that trains every week on the day before market day.

**Languages:**  In Gaia, the people speak Zephyran, and some also speak Gnomish, though knowledge of the language has waned somewhat as the gnomes have been integrated into Gaian society.

#### Kylf

**Kylf** lies to the east and northeast of Gaia. The inhabitants are called Kylves, the adjectival form is Kylven, and their language is called Kylven. Southern Kylf butts up agains the Soothills, and, like Gaia, has a substantial gnomish population.

Kylf is a country of rolling hills, and most Kylvens are herders and ranchers.  Their military consists of mounted knights and mounted archers (both of these are available as fighter archetypes for characters from Kylf).  Kylf produces the best horses in the Zephyrlands, renouned for their speed and bravery, and the Kylven Dogsteed is the favored steed of gnomes throughout the Zephyrlands.

Kylven life centers around horses and ranching.  Children grow up riding horses and most families own ranches.  Common pasttimes are dressage, polo, and horse racing, which Kylvens take very seriously.

**Languages:** Kylven, Zephyran, and possibly Gnomish.

#### Muldr

**Muldr** lies on the southwest coast of the continent, and basically consists of a single immense city on the Sinaran Ocean.  Muldrians are seafarers, traders, and merchants.  Their national wealth comes exclusively from trading with their landbound neighbors, so when the Zephyran Empire fell, they were forced to find other customers for their wares, and now spend most of their time exploring the Sinaran Ocean and beyond.  

**Languages:** The Muldrians were always a part of what is now Gaia, and so never developed a separate regional language.  All Mudorians speak Zephyran, and most speak at least some of the languages of their neighbors.

```
```

#### Vella

**Vella** lies to the north and northwest of Gaia, between the northern Western Ocean and the Thundersnow Tundra. The inhabitants are called Vellans, and their language is Vellish.

Vella butts up against the Thundersnow Tundra to the north and many wheels of grassland to the south.

#### Esh

**Esh** was once a region of the Zephyrlands that lay between Onoklat (now called the Soothills) and Genouj, but it was completely destroyed by the Orcs in the Great Devastation.  The survivors decided it was too much trouble to try to rebuild, and chose to simply leave their lands forever, endlessly wandering the Zephyrlands.  The *Eshen*, as they call themselves, have been living out of caravans ever since.

Eshen caravans are fairly small: Usually no more than 20 to 30 wagons, and under 200 people.  Eshen are highly skilled craftsmen and artists, and trade their crafts and art for the food that they cannot produce themselves. The Eshen were able to salvage much of their magical knowledge when they fled their burning lands; as a result, there are a large number of Eshen mages, of all specializations.  Every Eshen caravan has a library wagon, usually heavily defended with glyphs and wards to ensure it is not damaged.

Every Eshen caravan will have a handful dedicated Warmages tasked with protecting the caravan from brigands and bandits, and every Eshen trains in combat from a young age.  The caravans are seldom as unprotected as they seem, as most raiders learn the hard way, so they very seldom get attacked.

**Languages:** Eshen speak their own language, called Eshen, as well as Zephyran.  Most of them also speak elvish; as wanderers, they often find themselves traveling with elven travelers, and are on good terms with them.

#### Genouj

**Genouj** (pronounced ga-NOSH) lies to the southeast of Gaia, bordering the Southern Sea and the central mountains. Genouj is a hot, arid land, populated almost exclusively by humans; elves and gnomes find its temperatures too inhospitable. The peoples are called Genoujians (ga-NOSH-ens), as is the language.

The Genoujians are a dark-skinned, Amazonian race, accustomed to living in inhospitable deserts where the air gets hot enough to fry a turtleduck egg in its shell. Genoujian males are treated as slaves, and perform only manual labor, while the females occupy all positions of power, influence, and creativity.

Genoujian mages (females only) use rune magic exclusively, and are divided into two types:  Rock Scribes, who inscribe their runes on rocks and use these to channel their power, and XXX, who tattoo the runes directly onto their skin.  In both cases, the runes function identically:  The runemage invokes the power imbued in the rune.  See the [runemage class description](runemage.md) for the details.

PCs from Genouj can be eith male or female, but make sure you play the backgrounds appropriately.

#### Selarius, The Elven Homelands

The elven homelands lie in the north/northeast-ish section of the Zephyrlands, in an isolated place that is very hard to find (some say it is protected by magic).

\page

## Provinces, Towns, Villages, and Outposts

There are a handful of fortified cities throughout the continent.  Gaia is called a *confederacy* because each of its 7 cities houses a powerful lord, who ostensibly controls the villages around his land, called a province.  These provinces correspond to the 7 nobles houses for the former Zephyran empire, one of which formerly belonged to the emperor's family.

Besides the cities, villages are the main urban unit, and they are scattered around the Zephyrlands, clustering near geographical features like rivers and major crossroads.  A town is simply a large village:  It will have more resources available to players, and a much larger exurban population.  The largest towns tend to be composed of several smaller towns that have congealed into a single urban mass.

Each town or village has the things the players will expect: a general store, an inn, maybe a few other stores, a common house (inn, tavern, and stables), and local government offices.  A larger town will have multiple of each.  Most villages have a weekly market (daily for towns) where local farmers send their harvests or goods to sell.  There will also be other buildings, shops, houses, and so on, especially to house the middle classes (merchants, artisans, craftsmen, etc).

The commoners live in farm houses proximal to their home villages, with their farmlands, pastures, and orchards surrounding their homes.  Artisans, craftsmen, and merchants will usually live in the village or town directly.

In addition to towns and villages, there are outposts scattered around the confederacy, similar to stables in Breath of the Wild.  An outpost usually only has an inn (including a stable), and sometimes a small general store.  They all fall on trade routes and frequently traveled roads, and rely on a steady stream of merchants, transporters, and travelers for both their goods and income.  These provide a safe place for the PCs to take long rests and recuperate, and occasionally use as a home base.  They will also be a good place for the PCs to meet up with NPCs, such as merchants or other travelers.  It is the most likely place for a PC to meet an elf or other unusal non-goblinoid humanoids.

The kingdoms are generally on good terms with each other, and trade and travel between them is very common, but travel between villages is dangerous: bandits have been known to prey on defenseless travelers and rich caravans.  Because Zephyrans rely so heavily on inter-village trade, finding work as a caravan guard is a good way for the young and strong to earn some money and establish their reputation.

Despite the heavy reliance on inter-village trade, most Zephyrans haven't traveled more than a few days away from their home village.  They are often very interested in news from the outside world, and will listen to stories from anyone willing to share them.  They especially like when elves visit, because they always bring news and stories from distant villages.

Gaian homes tend to be short, squat, and wide, with low ceilings and wraparound porches, and gently-slanted roofs.  Building materials depend on the resources in the area, but wood is the most common.  Every house has a fireplace in it, as the focal point of the household life.  Beds tend to be wide and low, sometimes sitting directly on the floor or ground, and it's not uncommon for children to sleep bunched together.  Larger farms and ranches are often collections of these buildings, connected by shared roofs and continuous porches.

## Demographics

The towns and villages of The Zephyrlands are primarily peopled by humans, with gnomes being very common in Gaia and Kylf.  The gnomes were driven from their traditional home in the eastern mountains during the Great Devastation, and have fully integrated into the human villages.  Elves from the north travel freely throughout the confederacy, though they seldom settle in the villages and towns.

A calculator built using this data is [here](http://qzil.com/kingdom/). -->

## Politics

In Gaia, each town and village has both a mayor, elected by the local villagers.  The local constabularies tend to be very small and composed of career officers, and typically reports to a police chief, who himself reports to the mayor.  The police chief doubles as the head of the militia, though by tradition only the mayor can declare war.

There will always be at least one government building in a village: The mayor's office, the military commander's office, the chief constable's office, and a few jail cells.  In small or even medium sized villages, these might just separate desks in a one-room building, although in most large villages, the constabulary will have their own building for the jails.

In addition to all this, the closest warlord will usually have a representative in all but the smallest of villages.  He is often little more than a figurehead, but an important one, and once a year he is responsible for collecting taxes from the village.  Accompanying the tax collector to the warlord's stronghold as a guard is a good way for an up and coming warrior to see a bot of the world.  An unlucky few towns fall equidistant between multiple warlords, and have a representative from each.

## Religion

Reverence for nature plays a major part in lives of Zephyrans, though there are no formal deities, observances, or ceremonies.  Zephyrans celebrate the new and full moons and the changing of the seasons with feast days.  The entire world is imbued with the power of nature, and some zephyrans are able to spontaneously draw on this power to change the world around them; these people are called druids, and some of them are quite powerful.  Because there are no formal religious ceremonies or dogmas, these druids don't necessarily hold positions of power or influence, though they are respected.  The Zephyrans recognize no deities or gods, and clerics are unknown.

\page

The closest a village will have to a holy day is their Rememberence Day, which every village has, and which differs for every village.  This day commemorates the day the orc hordes descended on their village during the Great Devastation, and is a day of solemn reflection and gratitude.  All work ceases on these days, and if they fall on a market day or a training day, the activities are just skipped and resumed the following week.


## Languages and Writing

The people of the confederacy all speak a common language, called Zephyran.  In general, throughout the kingdoms, only merchants, travelers, and mages are literate, though all commoners can do enough math to buy and sell their goods.  If a character can read and write, that should be noted on their sheet along with the languages they speak.

Most gnomes can speak gnomish, and many Gaians and Kylvens can, as well, assuming they are in contact with gnomes often.  Gnomes tend to school their children, so most gnomes will be able to read and write.

The elves have their own language, with a complex literary and poetic tradition.  Very few humans or gnomes know how to speak it, but most elves can speak Zephyran.

## Currency

The standard unit of currency throughout the Zephyrlands is the *gilder*, a small, lumpy silver coin about the size of a flattened blueberry with a hole in the center.  There are also copper coins called *bits* and gold goins called *marks*, each of which have the same size and shape as a gilder, and corresponds to 1/10 and 10 gilders, respectively.  Gilders are usually strung together on a piece of twine with a clasp, called a clamp, rather than kept loose in a purse.  These clamps are sometimes worn as jewelry, especially as long necklaces or bracelets, to discourage pickpockets. Clamps are so-named because of the clever fasteners they employ, which allow quick access to the strung gilders.  About 5 or 6 gilders will fit on an inch of twine, so carrying or storing large amounts of money can get bulky quickly.  The cost of everything in the PHB is listed in GP, which convert directly to gilders; every time you see "gold piece" substitute gilder.

Gilders were the currency of the Zephyran empire, which of course has not made any more since the Great Devastation, but none of the warlords are able to secure enough power to start minting gilders again.  The gold of which gilders are made is valuable on its own, and the gilder provides a standardized unit of measure for this gold, but it is not inconceivable that the gilder *qua* gilder will lose its value at some point.

Gemstones are also common; they are not used as currency, but as decorative elements, and can be traded or sold to craftsmen or artificers for components.  Some say that gemstones have magical powers locked inside them, although there simply aren't enough mages left to confirm.

Very few villages or towns have anything like a banking system, so the PCs will need to figure out how to store and maintain their wealth -- assuming they amass any, of course.

## Calendar and Time

The calendar is broken up into 4 seasons, and each season is broken up into 3 28-day lunar months.  The seasons change on the solstices and equinoxes, and the full moon is always on the 7th day of the month and the new moon is always on the 21st day of the month.  There are major feast days for each change of season, and minor feast days for each full moon and new moon.  Time is expressed as "X days (before|after) the Yth (full|new) moon [in the Z season]"; for example: "3 days after the 3rd full moon of the winter" means March 24th, and "6 days before the 2nd new moon on spring" means May 1st.

## Combat

Life in the villages and towns is relatively safe, but once you venture beyond those limits, things tends to get more interesting and dangerous.  Martial weapons and heavy armors are uncommon and difficult to get in villages, but are easy to get in larger towns.  Adventurers, caravan guards, and the like will carry martial weapons, but the militias use mostly simple weapons like spears, short bows, daggers, and clubs.

In many of the larger towns, especially ones that see a lot of travelers, martial weapons such as swords are required to be tied closed with a special red ribbon, provided at the entrance to the town.  This signifies that the bearer has come in peace.

## Monsters

Kobold bandits are a recurring problem for the villages in the Goldenwood area.  Kobolds are small, degenerate, dog-faced humanoids, and always attack in swarms.  Luckily, they are weak and cowardly and can be defeated with a few well-placed explosives or fireballs.  They have been known to attack caravans and villages alike.

Some of the more remote villages are occasionally attacked by gnolls. Human-sized, hyena-headed, and destructive, gnolls pose a much larger threat to the villages than kobolds, but luckily are much more rare.

Rangers, Scouts, and other explorers occasionally stumble upon ogres deep in the woods.  These stupid creatures will savagely attack humans on sight, so it's best to simply avoid them whenever possible.

Finally, everyone knows orcs are a thing, though they haven't been seen en masse since the Great Devastation.

\page

## Animals

The Zephyrlands have the usual wild animal species, but also has a number of animals that don't exist in our world, including the otak (from Earthsea) and the torro (a small, intelligent monkey).  These are detailed in [their own page](animals.md).

## Magic

The land, and nature, is imbued with a subtle magic.  Low-level nature magic is common, but arcane magic has almost disappeared since the Great Devastation.  Some people develop and affinity for nature, and learn some simple nature magics; a few of these people become *druids*.  *Mages* learn to manipulate the arcane forces of the universe into the effects they desire, using the force of their will alone.  Where druids work in harmony with nature, mages are often contrary to nature; for this reason, druids are often suspicious toward, or occasionally downright hostile to, mages.  There are rumors of other types of magic in the lands, but the average Zephyran will only have heard rumors.

Low-powered magic items are common, especially those that can be produced by druids, like potions and salves.  Most druids learn to brew potions early in their career.  After the destruction of the schools of magic, more powerful magic itemssuch as enchanted weapons, armors, and more esoteric items, have mostly disappeared.

Some of the general population can tap into the magic of nature directly, and [can learn to create small magical effects](magic.md#non-spellcasters).  This potentially includes the PCs.

There are several common magic items that can be purchased from merchants, like potions of healing, rings of protection, enchanted arrows, and clothes with special properties.  The prices for these items will vary greatly, based on availability and rarity of the item.
