# Equipment

Equipment availability is generally the same as described in the PHB. Because of how uncommon weapons of war are, armor, shields, and martial weapons are seldom available for purchase in the smaller villages, though they will be readily available in towns.

## Unique Weapons

- **Baston.** A filipino-style jo stick.
- **Caestus.** A [glove weapon](https://www.google.com/search?q=caestus+glove&tbm=isch) that adds 1d4 to unarmed damage.
- **Macuahuitl.** A [wooden sword with spikes along the end](https://www.google.com/search?q=macuahuitl&tbm=isch).  Damage like a spiked bat.

## Missing Weapons

Notably absent are crossbows of all types.

## Armor

Because the Zephyrlands consists of farming and ranching kingdoms, metal armor other than chain mail is very rare, and will be difficult to get.  The same is true for large shields.

## Horses

In the Zephyrlands, native horses are common and easily available, so they are cheaper than the prices listed in the PHB (50 gilders for a riding horse).

The best horses come from Kylf, however, and these are both difficult to get and much more expensive, costing 200 gilders or more.

## Kylven Dogsteeds

Kylven Dogsteeds, or just dogsteeds, are preferred by gnomes throughout the continent.  They are uncommon, and cost about 100 gilders apiece.
