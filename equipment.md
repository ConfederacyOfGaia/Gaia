# Equipment

Equipment availability is generally the same as described in the PHB. Because of how uncommon weapons of war are, armor, shields, and martial weapons are seldom available for purchase in the smaller villages, though they will be readily available in towns.

## Unique Weapons

- **Baston.** A filipino-style jo stick.
- **Caestus.** A [glove weapon](https://www.google.com/search?q=caestus+glove&tbm=isch) that adds 1d4 to unarmed damage.
- **Macuahuitl.** A [wooden sword with spikes along the end](https://www.google.com/search?q=macuahuitl&tbm=isch).  Damage like a spiked bat.

## Horses

Horses are common and easily available, so they are cheaper than the prices listed in the PHB (50 gilders for a riding horse). Fantastic animals are generally not available, nor are animals like elephants, war dogs, and the like.
