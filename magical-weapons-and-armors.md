Magical items and artifacts in the Age of the Great Dragons.

Integrate items from [this 3.5 listing](http://www.realmshelps.net/magic/magweapon-spec.shtml).


Legends of powerful weapons and wonderous artifacts abound, often named for the mythical hero that created them, owned them, or made them famous. Many of the most famous tales the bards tell revolve around them, from Hew, the wooden greataxe of Magnus the Invincable, to Throatcutter, a dagger made from the spine of a demon -- and possessed by it.

These magical weapons are millenia old.  Each one is a named entity, usually non-sentient, with specific powers and lore.  Mechanically, one might be just *longsword +1* but there will usually be [special features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure#SpecialFeatures) to it.  A named weapon requires attunement.

Just like with arcane magic, goblinoids are just as likely as humanoids to have access to magical weapons.

### Evolving Items

Unless otherwise indicated, a named item grows in power along with its attuned wielder.

| Tier | Character Level | Magical Bonus | Additional Damage
| :-:  | :---: | :---: | :---: 
| 1    | 1-4   | +0    | 1d4
| 2    | 5-10  | +1    | 1d6
| 3    | 11-16 | +2    | 1d8
| 4    | 17-20 | +3    | 1d10

### Attunement Bonuses

A wielder that is attuned to a named item often gains additional abilities.  If an **Attunement Bonus** section exists for an item, the abilities listed in it are only available when attuned to the item.
