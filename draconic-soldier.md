### Aurelian Soldier

The draconic guards of the Great Golden Dragon's empire train in a specific way, and have their own martial archetype.  They are known far and wide for their impeccable training and martial prowess.

Draconic Soldiers dress in tooled, black studded leather armor and a long golden tabard.  They carry a glaive, a longsword, and a dagger as part of their official gear.

As an organization, Draconic Soldiers favor strength and intelligence, so fighters to take this archetype tend to have higher Intelligence scores than other archetypes.

#### Impeccable Training

Starting at 3rd level, your years of training with your fellow soldiers have taught you to move and act quickly in combat.  When you are wielding a weapon, and an ally within your reach is targetted by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack.

In addition, your training enables you to take the Disengage, Dodge, or Help action as a bonus action.

#### Imposing Presence

At 3rd level, your presence carries with it the weight of the empire.  When you are dressed in your uniform, you have advantage on Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks against anyone who is aware of the Great Golden Dragon.

#### Local Knowledge

At 3rd level, you have been stationed in a region for long enough to have learned the local languages, customs, and history.  You learn the Draconic language, if you  don't already know it, and 2 additional languages common to the area.  You learn an additional language at 10th level, and another at 15th level.

Also, whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to local customs or culter, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

#### Master of War and Peace

*This level indicates an elite soldier or special operative.*

At 7th level, your knowledge of combat tactics and troop maneuvers allows you to add your Intelligence modifier to your Initiative rolls (minimum of 1).  You also gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.

Also at 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Investigation skill, if you don't already have it.  You may add double your proficiency bonus to any ability check that would benefit from it.

#### Inspiring leader

*This level indicates a regional leader.*

At 10th level, you gain the ability to inspire those under your command.  As an action, you can issue a short, rousing speech.  Each ally within 30 feet of you and who can hear you gains the benefits of the *bless* spell for 1 minute, until you choose to end it, or until you are incapacitated (no concentration required).  Once you use this ability, you must complete a long or short rest before you can use it again.

#### Improved Inspiration

*This level is for the most senior field generals.*

Starting at 15th level, when you use your Inspiring Leader feature, all the affected allies have advantage on any attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### 18th level

*The main general of the army*
