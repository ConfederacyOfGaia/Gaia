# Character Options

## Start Here

*Adopted from [Pete Wailes' article](https://wail.es/player-tips-18-ish-d-d-character-backstory-questions/)*

When creating a new character, it's useful to have a fleshed-out backstory. That way, whenever you have to improv how your character responds, you'll have a thorough understanding of how their [alignment and motivation](https://wail.es/lessons-learned-rpg-character-alignment-examples-motivation/) will influence them, what they're going to feel about the events in front of them, and how to best respond. After all, the *r* in RPG stands for **role** not roll.

So with that in mind, here's the steps I go through and questions I ask whenever I'm creating either a player character or a larger-role NPC. Hopefully you might find it useful too.

1. What's their name? Do they have any nicknames?
1. How old are they chronologically, and how old do they appear?
1. Physical characteristics, standard clothing and equipment
1. Secondary characteristics - accent, tone of voice, mannerisms, ticks etc
1. Emotional characteristics - are they prone to getting angry/laid back/investigative/despondent etc, personal prejudices?
1. How do their emotional characteristics affect how they interact with people/groups?
1. Alignment, motivation and character flaws/needs
1. What were the defining moments/events from their history?
1. What do they most fear?
1. Do they have any secrets? Who have they told, if anyone?
1. Where are they from? Do they have relevant cultural associations/quirks? How patriotic & nationalistic are they?
1. What was their childhood like?
1. Who are their parents & siblings, and husband/wife/significant other?
1. Status of immediate family (including any children) and friends - alive/dead/missing
1. What's their profession and hobbies?
1. Do they have a religious affiliation, and if so what is it and how strong?
1. What are their major personal beliefs/ideologies?
1. Do they have favourite foods/drinks?
1. Why are they here, specifically? What are they looking to get out of the adventure?


## Race, Culture, and Backgrounds

D&D traditionally conflates race and culture, but in Gaia, these are distinct:

- ***[Race](races.md)*** defines size, height, weight, speed, inital ability score modifications, and other race-specific features.
- ***[Culture](cultures.md)*** defines languages and available backgrounds.
- ***[Background](backgrounds.md)*** defines starting skills and money.

If randomly rolling for character race, use a d6:

Roll | Race
---- | ----
1-3 | Human
4-5 | Gnome
6 | Elf

## Initial ability score generation

Because PCs are considered extraordinary, the ability score generation options tends to produce powerful characters.  Roll 3d4+5 7 times, discard the lowest score, and then arrange the rest however you want.  Finally, add racial and class modifiers.

```
$ roll 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 | sort -nr | head -6
```

In addition to racial ability score bonuses, each class gets +1 to each of their primary ability scores (the ones listed as Saving Throw proficiencies) to indicate the training they've received.

## Feats

Because of the relative scarcity of magic items, the optional Feats rules are in effect in this campaign.  Many subclasses give free Feats as class features, and a character can always choose a Feat instead of an ability score increase.  Because many feats add powerful combat abilities and specializations, in order to choose a feat the character must have an in-game reason for it.  For example, a character that has never touched a dagger before cannot take the Dagger Master Feat, and a character generally needs a teacher to take the Martial Arts Feat.

## Character Class Overview and Availabilty 

This campaign setting is very different from many others; it is combat-heavy, but magical-combat low, and the emphasis is on skills rather than magic (both spells and magic items).  High-powered wizardly generalists don't exist:  mages specialize early, which is the only way to advance, but the expectation of combat is there.
