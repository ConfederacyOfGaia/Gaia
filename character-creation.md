# Character Options

## Race, Culture, and Backgrounds

D&D traditionally conflates race and culture, but in Gaia, these are distinct:

- ***[Race](races.md)*** defines size, height, weight, speed, inital ability score modifications, and other race-specific features.
- ***[Culture](cultures.md)*** defines languages and available backgrounds.
- ***[Background](backgrounds.md)*** defines starting skills and money.

If randomly rolling for character race, use a d6:

Roll | Race
---- | ----
1-3 | Human
4-5 | Gnome
6 | Elf

## Initial ability score generation

Because PCs are considered extraordinary, the ability score generation options tends to produce powerful characters.  Roll 3d4+5 7 times, discard the lowest score, and then arrange the rest however you want.  Finally, add racial and class modifiers.

```
$ roll 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 3d4+5 | sort -nr | head -6
```

In addition to racial ability score bonuses, each class gets +1 to each of their primary ability scores (the ones listed as Saving Throw proficiencies) to indicate the training they've received.

## Feats

Because of the relative scarcity of magic items, the optional Feats rules are in effect in this campaign.  Many subclasses give free Feats as class features, and a character can always choose a Feat instead of an ability score increase.  Because many feats add powerful combat abilities and specializations, in order to choose a feat the character must have an in-game reason for it.  For example, a character that has never touched a dagger before cannot take the Dagger Master Feat, and a character generally needs a teacher to take the Martial Arts Feat.

## Character Class Overview and Availabilty 

This campaign setting is very different from many others; it is combat-heavy, but magical-combat low, and the emphasis is on skills rather than magic (both spells and magic items).  High-powered wizardly generalists don't exist:  mages specialize early, which is the only way to advance, but the expectation of combat is there.
