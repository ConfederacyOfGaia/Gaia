# Character Options

If randomly rolling for character race, use a d6:

Roll | Race
---- | ----
1-3 | Human
4-5 | Gnome
6 | Elf

Unlike traditional campaigns, starting money is based on the character's background rather than their class.

Because of the relative scarcity of magic items (see below), the optional Feats rules are in effect in this campaign.  All characters advance according to the following table:

Experience Points | Level | Proficiency Bonus | Feature
:---|:---:|:---:|:---
0	| 1	| +2 | 
300	| 2	| +2 | Feat
900	| 3	| +2 | 
2,700	| 4	| +2 | Ability Score Increase
6,500	| 5	| +3 | 
14,000	| 6	| +3 | Feat
23,000	| 7	| +3 | 
34,000	| 8	| +3 | Ability Score Increase
48,000	| 9	| +4 | 
64,000	| 10 | +4 | Feat
85,000	| 11 | +4 | 
100,000 | 12 | +4 | Ability Score Increase
120,000 | 13 | +5 | 
140,000 | 14 | +5 | Feat
165,000 | 15 | +5 | 
195,000 | 16 | +5 | Ability Score Increase
225,000 | 17 | +6 | 
265,000 | 18 | +6 | Feat
305,000 | 19 | +6 | 
355,000 | 20 | +6 | Ability Score Increase

Characters can still take a Feat in place of an ability score increase whenever they earn one.  This schedule of Feats and ability score increases overrides those of each class.

## Initial ability score generation

Because PCs are considered extraordinary, the ability score generation options tends to produce powerful characters.  Roll 3d4+5 six times and arrange them however you want, and then add racial modifiers.

In addition to racial ability score bonuses, each class gets +1 to each of their primary ability scores (the ones listed as Saving Throw proficiencies) to indicate the training they've received.
