The orcs of Enda have had a form of runic magic for centuries.  They developed it using the volcanic waters of the Bowl of Fire and the runes of the Giant language.  In order to wield this runic magic, special runes must be tattood on your skin; each rune corresponds to a specific power, and the more powerful the spell, the larger the runes that make it up. In addition, these runic tattoos strengthen your body against physical hardship, and provide a buffer against damage.

This magical ink is made from certain herbs, flowers, roots, and seeds found only in the Bowl of Fire, which are mashed up and mixed with the volcanic water from the Bowl of Fire.  This ink is then used to permanently carve the runes into the bearers flesh.  When a power is activated, the rune that corresponds to it glows briefly (the Subtle Spell metamagic inhibits this).

The orcs of the Bowl of Fire only teach this form of magic to those they trust, so it will be limited mostly to orcs.  In addition, the ink required to learn more spells can only be created in the Bowl of Fire itself.

Because your tattoos are the source of your power, if your physical form is transformed in such a way that they are not present (*polymorph*, the Wild Shape class feature, etc), you cannot cast spells more powerful than cantrips, assuing the form you inhabit allows you to cast spells at all. This does not affect effects you are already concentrating on.

#### Protective Ward

Your tattoos provide extra toughness and resiliance. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, when you are not wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Dexterity modifier. If you are proficient with shields, you can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Bonus Proficiency

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with tattooers tools, and can add your proficiency bonus to Performance (Dexterity) checks when using them to tattoo runes onto living flesh.

#### Aura of Protection

Also at 1st level, you learn to draw upon the protective ward created by your runes to protect yourself from harm. As a bonus action, or as a reaction to being hit by a weapon attack, you can spend a sorcerer spell slot of any level and cause your runes to form an aura of protection around your body. While this aura of protection is in effect, you have resistance to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage, including the triggering damage (if it was enabled as a reaction).  This protective aura lasts for one minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action, and persists even if you are unconscious. 

Once you gain the Font of Magic feature at 2nd level, you can choose to expend 2 sorcery points instead of a sorcerer spell slot to activate your aura of protection.

#### Aura of Resistance

At 6th level, when your Aura of Protection is active, you have resistance to all damage types except psychic.

#### Master Tattooer

Also at 6th level, your mastery of tattooing tools increases.  When you use tattooers tools on living flesh, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to your Performance (Dexterity) checks.

#### Improved Protective Ward

Starting at 14th level, your Protection Ward extends to all aspects of your life.  Whenever you must make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

#### Aura of Invulnerability

Starting at 18th level, when you activate your Aura of Protection, you can choose to cast the *invulnerability* spell on yourself at the same time by spending 10 sorcery points. Casting invulnerability in this way does not expend material components or require concentration.
