The orcs of Enda have had a form of runic magic for centuries.  They developed it using the volcanic waters of the Bowl of Fire and the runes of the Giant language.  In order to wield this magic, special runes must be tattood on your skin; each rune corresponds to a specific power, and the more powerful the spell, the larger the runes that make it up. In addition, these runic tattoos strengthen your body against physical hardship, and provide a buffer against damage.

The runes require a special magical ink, made from certain herbs, flowers, roots, and seeds found only in the Bowl of Fire, which are mashed up and mixed with the volcanic water from the Slumbering Giant.  This ink is then used to permanently carve the runes into the bearer's flesh.  

The orcs of the Bowl of Fire only teach this form of magic to those they trust, so it will be limited mostly to orcs.  In addition, the ink required to learn more spells can only be created in the Bowl of Fire itself.

#### Don't Quit Your Day Job

There are no professional magic wielders, which means you have the standard set of adventuring skills in addition to your spellcasting abilities, and you probably dress as a warrior or commoner.  At 1st level, you gain proficiency with light armor and simple weapons, and your hit die becomes a d8 instead of a d6.  Your list of skill choices changes to **Deception**, **History**, **Insight**, **Investigation**, **Nature**, **Perception**, and **Survival**.

#### Living Runes

Your tattoos are the source of your power.  When you learn a new spell, you must tattoo it onto your flesh.  Many sorcerers embellish their tattoos beyond the runes, adding extra flair, scenes from nature, the names of friends or family, additional colors, and so on, so the tattoos of two different sorcerers might look totally different from each other while still encoding the same spells.  These extra flourishes do not affect the power or strength of the magic.  When you cast a spell, the runes that corresponds to it glows briefly (the Subtle Spell metamagic inhibits this).

Because your tattoos are the source of your power, if your physical form is transformed in such a way that they are not present (*polymorph*, Wildshape class feature, etc), you cannot cast spells more powerful than cantrips, assuing the form you inhabit allows you to cast spells at all. This does not affect spells you are already concentrating on.

##### Multiclass Requirements

In order to multiclass in, you must know how to read and write the hieroglyphic runes of the Giant language.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with calligrapher's tools, and you learn to use them to create tattoos on living flesh.  When creating a tattoo, you can add your proficiency bonus to all related Performance (Dexterity) checks.

In addition, if this is your first character level, you learn to read and write the hieroglyphic runes of the Giant language.

#### Protective Ward

Your tattoos provide extra toughness and resiliance. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, when you are not wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Dexterity modifier. If you are proficient with shields, you can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Aura of Protection

You learn the *blade ward* and *resistance* cantrips, which are sorcerer cantrips for you. The range of these spells changes to self, and the casting time becomes 1 bonus action. They do not count against your number of sorcerer cantrips known.

You also learn the *absorb elements* and *shield* spells, which don't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. Once you reach 2nd level in this class, you can cast them by spending 1 sorcery point or by expending a spell slot.

#### Self Mastery

At 6th level, you learn the *alter self* and *enhance ability* spells, if you don't already know them. They do not count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast each of them by spending 2 sorcery points or by using a spell slot. If you cast them with sorcery points, they do not require concentration and have a range of self.

#### Master Tattooer

Also at 6th level, your mastery of tattooing increases.  When you use calligrapher's tools on living flesh, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to your Performance (Dexterity) checks.

#### Improved Protective Ward

Starting at 14th level, your Protection Ward extends to all aspects of your life.  Whenever you must make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

#### Aura of Invulnerability

Starting at 18th level, you learn the *invulnerability* spell.  You can cast it using a spell slot or by spending 10 sorcery points. When you cast it using sorcery points, it does not expend material components or require concentration.
