# Ranger

Rangers are explorers, trackers, and scouts, living in the wilderness and communing with nature.  They are common in the confederacy, often adopting a particular forest or area near their home village and acting as its protector.

## Notes

* The overall feel of a ranger is basically a martial druid/protector.
* Gnomes are never rangers.
* Rangers have Gaian Affinity, just like druids, and suffer the identical limitations (10%, +1h rest)
* At 7th level, rangers gain the ability to make potions and salves like a druid.
* At 5th level, rangers gain the [Commune With Nature Feat](feats.md#commune-with-nature) at some point.

## Archetypes

* Beastmaster
* Hunter
* Goblin Hunter (all goblinoids)
* Dragon Hunter (maybe?)
* Scout
* Protector (chooses a place and defends it)
