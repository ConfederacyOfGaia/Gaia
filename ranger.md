# Ranger

Rangers are explorers, trackers, and scouts, living in the wilderness and communing with nature.  They are common in the confederacy, often adopting a particular forest or area near their home village and acting as its protector.

Gaian rangers use the Rugged Ranger class, rather than the PHB ranger class.
