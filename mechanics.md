# The Confederacy of Gaia - Campaign Mechanics

Gaia-specific mechanics for creating characters and playing the game.

## Character Options

If randomly rolling for character race, use a d12:

Roll | Race
---- | ----
1-3 | Human
4-5 | Gnome
6 | Elf

Consult the Races, Classes, and Backgrounds sections for more details on these aspects of character creation.

Unlike traditional campaigns, starting money is based on the character's background rather than their class.

### Ability score generation

Because PCs are considered extraordinary, the ability score generation options tends to produce powerful characters.

#### Option 1: Points

Start with a base score of 9 in each ability, and distribute 30 points among your ability scores.  If you evenly distribute these points, your character will have a 14 in all ability scores, not counting racial modifiers.

#### Option 2: Rolling

Roll 4d4, discard the lowest die, and add 5.  Repeat until you have 7 scores, discard the lowest, then arrange the rest as desired.  This will give scores in the 8-17 range, and will tend to run high because of the extra die.

#### Option 3: Standard Distribution

Arrange the following scores however you want, and then add racial adjustments:  15, 15, 13, 13, 11, 11.

## Races

### Humans

Humans are one of the three dominant species of Gaia, and behave exactly as humans from the PHB.  In general, humans have olive complexions, dark hair, and dark eyes, although other colorations are possible.  Use the Variant Human rules on PHB 31:

**Ability Score Increase.**  Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.
**Skills.** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
**Feat.**  You gain one Feat of your choice.

### Gnomes

Gnomes originally made their home in the eastern hills, but several centuries ago, the orcs came down from the mountains and took over the gnomish homelands.  The gnomes fled west, toward the sea, where they were welcomed by the humans of Gaia.  They assimilated into Gaian culture, and have been part of it ever since.

### Elves

Elves hail from the forest of the north and northeast, and are great travelers, especially in their youth.  They rarely settle in Gaia but are common travelers.

Elves tend towards chestnut brown skin and hair, and are usually shorter than gaians.  Gaian elves are identical to wood elves in the PHB.  They start the game with the Mage Cantrip Feat.

## Backgrounds

### Artisan or Merchant

You have proficiency with the tools of their trade and proficiency with the History skill as it related to their craft or trade.  Starting money will be 5d4x10, and they will start with the tools required by their trade.  If the character is an artisan, they are likely an apprentice, or the child of an artisan, but there are other options; for example, the character might have been a blacksmith whose forge burned down, and rather than rebuild they chose a wandering life.

### Gnomish Craftsman

Gnomish Craftsmen are legendary metalworkers, miners, masons, brewers, and artisans.  Pick a craft, and you begin play with proficiency in the tools of your trade, and proficiency in the History skill, related to your craft.  Dwarven Craftsmen start the game with 10d4x10 gilders and the tools of your craft (if that makes sense).

### Farmer

You come from a family of farmers.  You can choose either the Nature or Survival skill in addition to your class skills.  
Being a farmer doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.

### Rancher

Your family are ranchers, so you get the Animal Handling skill in addition to your class skills.  Being a rancher doesn't necessarily mean that you come from a poor family, so starting gilders can vary quite a bit: 2d20x10.

### Outlander

A character with the outlander background will be a member of one of the outlander caravans.  This means they were either born into it or joined the community at a young age.  Outlanders know how to play a musical instrument of their choice, know the outlander language, and automatically gain the Survival skill. Starting money for outlanders is very low, 1d4x10, but they will already have access to most equipment they will need, having been acquired from the community.

## Classes

The Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Paladin, Sorcerer, Wizard, and Warlock classes don't exist here.  Mages take the place of Wizards.  Monk is a prestige class, open to players of 7th level or higher.  Multiclassing functions as usual.

### Druid

Druids devote their lives to studying the natural world. They are attuned to nature, and, in return, they draw magical power from it.  Most druids discover their powers by accident, rather than through training, but all of them learn to control the elements, the plants and beasts of the forests, hills, plains, and mountains, and the very essence of life itself.

Gaian druids behave mostly as described in the PHB, with a few changes and additional abilities:
At 5th level, druids earn the Commune With Nature feat.
At 7th level, druids learn to make magical potions and salves that duplicate spell effects.  They also learn to make anti-venoms at this level.

#### Magic

Druids' magic use is governed by spell points, according to the following table:

At every level, a druid adds their Wisdom bonus to their number of spell points.  Thus, a 14th level druid with a Wisdom of 16 (+3) would have an additional 42 points (14 x 3), for a total of 145 points.

#### Creating magical potions and salves

The process to create a potion or salve takes the correct materials, 2d10 hours minus 1 hour per druid level (minimum of 1 hour), and the casting of the spell that the potion or salve recreates. If the spell is cast at a higher level, the effect of the potion of salve is increased.  Most of this time is spent letting the potion cook/ferment/age/infuse, so the druid can rest or study, but cannot leave their work area.  At the end of the required time, the druid must make a Nature check (DC varies based on type of portion or salve) to see if the attempt succeeded.  The materials required vary based on the type of potion and spell, and can become quite expensive due to rarity or quantity.  The DM will have a complete list of the necessary ingredients.

#### Circles

The circles from the PHB are available to druids (CIrcle of the Land and Circle of the Moon), as well as Circle of the Beast and Circle of Flora.

### Fighter

Life in Gaia can be tough, and everyone appreciates a strong warrior.  Fighters comprise the militias, caravan guards, and most of the adventurers of the world.  They are the battle masters, the champions of combat, and the master tacticians.

Almost options from the PHB are available here, with the exception of the Eldritch Knight archetype.  The Brawler martial archetype is available.

#### Martial Archetypes

* Champion.  Per PHB 72.
* Battle Master.  Per PHB 73.
* Brawler.  Per this doc
* Kensai.  Specializes in a single weapon (needs clarification)
* Arcane Archer. Per this doc.

### Ranger

Rangers are explorers, trackers, and scouts, living in the wilderness and communing with nature.  They are common in the confederacy, often adopting a particular forest or area near their home village and acting as its protector.

Gaian rangers use the Rugged Ranger class, rather than the PHB ranger class.

### Rogue

Rogues live by their wits and cleverness, instead of brute strength or hard work.  Scouts, acrobats, and circus performers fall into this category, as do thieves and con men.

Rogues are identical to their PHB counterparts, with these exceptions:  The Arcane Trickster archetype is not available.  The Scout archetype is also available.

### Mage

A Mage is a wielder of arcane magic, shaping the world to their whims.  Unlike druids, who strive to live in harmony with nature, mages seek to impose their will on reality.

Users of arcane magic are rare.  They will almost always be self-taught, and will be working from lost scraps of spellbooks they find in attics or dusty libraries.  See this class definition for all the details, including which schools of magic a character can choose.

Outlanders make powerful magic users, favor the Abjuration, Conjuration, Enchantment, and Illusion schools, and never learn Necromancy magic.  These mages can be a rich source of magical lore and spells for the characters.

Gnome mages favor the Enchantment, Evocation, and Illusion.

## Feats

The optional Feat rules are in place for this campaign, and a character may take a Feat instead of an ability score increase.

The following Feats are available, in addition to the Feats described in the PHB.  The Skill-related Feats from the Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills article are also available; any character with a particular Skill may take the corresponding Feat (when they are eligible for a Feat).  The Martial Artist and Master Martial Artist Feats are also available.

### Animal Empathy

Your presence doesn't offend wild animals. You gain the following benefits:
Increase your Charisma or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to train and command animals, and on Charisma checks made to deal with animals.
Normal animals don't attack you unless provoked or commanded.

### Animal Senses

You have keen senses, like those of an animal.
Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing or smell.
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to follow tracks one hour or less old. This advantage is lost if it rains more than lightly, or the target travels across or through water.

### Apothecary

*Prerequisite: Druid, 3rd level or higher; Ranger, 5th level or higher.*

You are skilled at gathering and using herbs for healing and harm.
Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You have advantage on Nature checks when creating potions, salves, and anti-venoms.

### Commune with Nature

The character learns how to rejuvenate by relaxing into nature and entering a very deep sleep.  The character requires half as much sleep to be fully rested (4 hours of communing with nature qualifies as a long rest, instead of 8) but is more difficult to awaken.  The character can be treated as sleeping for purposes of combat and surprise, but naturally wakes up in half the time.

### Druid Cantrip

*Prerequisite: Wisdom 11 or greater*
Due to extensive familiarity with nature, you have learned one druidic cantrip from the PHB's list, and can cast it at will.  This Feat is open to any class.  you can take this Feat multiple times, learning a new cantrip on each occasion.  In addition, your Wisdom increases by 1 point, up to a maximum of 20.

### Everybody’s Friend

You develop your magnetic personality to ease your way through the world. You gain the following benefits:
Increase your Charisma score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. If you’re already proficient in either skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with that skill.

### Knife Master

Your chosen weapon may be short, but few dare to enter your dagger range. You gain the following benefits:
Your attacks with the dagger cause 2d4 instead of 1d4.
If you are wielding two daggers, the damage from your second attack adds your ability score bonus.
Attacking with thrown a dagger at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls.
When you use the Dodge action, you may use a bonus action to make an attack with a dagger.

### Mage Cantrip

*Prerequisite: Intelligence 11 or greater*

You can learn one mage cantrip from the PHB's list, and can cast it at will.  This Feat is open to any class, but requires studying with a Mage that can already cast the cantrip.  You can take this Feat multiple times, learning a new cantrip on each occasion.  In addition, your Intelligence increases by 1 point, up to a maximum of 20.

### Master War Mage

*Prerequisite: The War Mage Feat*

When you take this Feat, your ability with the mage armor and magic missile spells improves noticeably:

Mage Armor: The target's AC becomes 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence bonus + the target's Dexterity bonus.
Magic Missile: Each dart does 1d4 + your proficiency bonus, and the number of darts you can create is equal to 2 + your proficiency bonus, without increasing the cost of the spell.

### Scimitar Master (whirlwind fighting)

*Prerequisite: proficiency with martial weapons*

You have mastered the art of fighting with dual scimitars. This can be taken in addition of the Weapon Specialization Feat with the scimitar, and the effects stack.
You get an additional attack per turn when welding dual scimitars.
Your damage bonus applies to your second attack.
You get a +2 bonus to AC against melee attacks when wielding dual scimitars, due to your increased ability to feint, parry, and deflect incoming weapons.

### Skill Mastery

Your character has honed their skills beyond the level of any other.
Your character has advantage on any skill check made using a skill in which they are proficient.
Add 1 point to the ability score of your choice, as long as it relates to a skill in which you are proficient.

### Skill Specialization

You specialize in one of your skills (player's choice):
Add 1 point to the ability score related to that skill, to a maximum of 20.
You now have expertise with this skill or tool, allowing you to add double your normal proficiency bonus to any ability check that would benefit from it.
When you make an ability check that benefits from part or all of your proficiency bonus and you roll a 1 on the d20, you may re-roll the die, though you must use the second result.

### Weapon Specialization

Choose one weapon that you are proficient with. Your mastery of this weapon grant you the following benefits:
Ability score increase:
If your chosen weapon is a ranged weapon, increase Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
If your chosen weapon is a finesse weapon, increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1 (player's choice), to a maximum of 20
Otherwise, increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20
When you roll a 1 on an attack roll with this weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. If you already have the ability to reroll a 1 from another source, such as the halfling's lucky trait, you can also reroll when you roll a 2 on an attack roll with this weapon.
When you roll 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

### War Mage

*Prerequisite: Mage*

When you take this Feat, you learn the mage armor and magic missile spells, if you don't already know them.  These spells cost half the normal spell point cost.  Additionally, the following modifications are in effect:

Mage Armor: The target's AC becomes 12 + your proficiency bonus + the target's Dexterity bonus.
Magic Missile: Each dart does 1d4 + your proficiency bonus.

## Equipment

Equipment availability is generally the same as described in the PHB.  Because of how uncommon weapons of war are, armor, shields, and martial weapons are seldom available for purchase in the smaller villages, though they will be readily available in towns.

Horses are common and easily available, so they are cheaper than the prices listed in the PHB (50 gilders for a riding horse).  Fantastic animals are generally not available, nor are animals like elephants, war dogs, and the like.
