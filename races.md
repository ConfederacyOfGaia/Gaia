# Races

There are three main races from which PCs can be drawn:  Humans, Gnomes, and Elves.  See the [Zephyrland Overview](zephyrlands.md) for full details of how these races interact.

## Cultures

Most D&D worlds conflate *race* and *culture*, though they are not necessarily the same.  Different kingdoms in the Zephyrlands have their own distinct cultures, and these cultures are expressed differently by the different races, so each kingdom's cultural specifics, as they impact character creation, are expressed as subraces.

## Humans

Humans are one of the three dominant species of Gaia, and behave exactly as humans from the PHB.  Skin, hair, and eye color varies with subrace.

### Human Traits

### Subraces

#### Gaian

___
- **Coloration:** Gaian humans have light skin, dark hair, and blue, green, or brown eyes.
- **Languages:** Zephyran, Gnomish.  Not all Kylvens speak Gnomish, but PCs can be assumed to.

#### Kylven

#### Genoujian

___
- **Coloration:** Genoujian humans have chestnut brown skin, black hair, and black or brown eyes.  Because they spend so much time in the hot sun, most are tanned so they appear darker than they are.
- **Languages:** Genoujian, Zephyran.

## Gnomes

Gnomes originally made their home in the eastern hills, at the base of the Great Mountains, until the Great Devastation.  The gnomes fled west, toward the sea, where they were welcomed by the humans of Gaia and Kylf.  They assimilated into the local cultures, and have been part of it ever since.

They tend to have very pale skin and pale hair (grey, silver, or white), and bright green or blue eyes.  Gnomish males and females are physically indistinguishable (unless they are naked, of course) -- they are the same general size and weight, and both have beards. Gnomes are very relaxed about both gender roles and sex roles, and homosexual pair bonding is as common as heterosexual pair bonding.  Since it is close to impossible for non-gnomes to distinguish male gnomes from female gnomes, many humans and elves adventure with their gnomish friends for years without knowing whether they are male or female.  It is considered rude to ask a gnome, because their culture does not distinguish gender roles.  Because of all of this, it is acceptable for a player to simply not list the gender of their gnome on their character sheet.

### Names

Gnomish names give no indication of its owner's gender.  In their homeland, gnomes went by a single name, which was chosen for them by their parents, but when they emigrated to the human lands, they adopted the human custom of using two names.  Because they had to make them up, these surnames tend to be related to their profession, and occasionally inspired:  Blackhammer, Gardentamer, Tunnelsmasher, Redbone, Hammerbanger, and so on.

### Class Preferences

Gnomes thrive as fighers, rogues, and mages.  They have a reputation of being serious craftsmen, amazing scholars, and clever inventors, with a strong tradition of arcane magic, although in this setting they do not have any particular affinity for spells of the illusion school.

Gnomish druids and raners are very rare since they were driven from their homelands in the Great Devastation: They simply don't yet feel the right connection to their new lands. Before the Great Devastation, gnomish druids were common, and very powerful.

There was a well-known school of arcane magic in the gnomish homeland, which was completely razed by the orcs during the Great Devastation. The gnomish mages that escaped have not yet recreated it, however, because of all the knowledge that was lost.

### Gnomes Traits
___
- **Ability Score Increase.** Intelligence +2, Dexterity +1
- **Age.** Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into and adult life by around age 40.  They can live 120 to 150 years.
- **Size.** Your size is Small.  Consult the chart below for your exact measurements.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
- **Gnome Cunning.** Advantage on Intellifence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.
- **Racial Enemy.** Gnomes have a long-standing and deep-seated hatred of orcs, and gain a +1 to hit when fighting them.

Unlike PHB gnomes, these gnomes do not have any kind of small animal affinity.

### Subraces

Gnomes only recently settling outside of their traditional homeland, so, physically, Gaian and Kylven gnomes are identical.  Their languages and backgrounds will vary based on where they grew up, however.

#### Gaian

___
- **Coloration:** Gaian gnomes tend to have very pale skin and pale hair (grey, silver, or white), and bright green or blue eyes.
- **Languages:** Zephyran, Gnomish.

#### Kylven

___
- **Coloration:** Kylven gnomes tend to have very pale skin and pale hair (grey, silver, or white), and bright green or blue eyes.
- **Languages:** Kylven, Zephyran, Gnomish.

## Elves

Elves hail from the forests of the north and northeast, and are great travelers, especially in their youth.  They rarely settle permanently outside their homelands, but are commonly seen wandering throughout the continent.

Elves thrive in all available classes.  As mages, they tend to favor the Sage specialization, though there are many Warmages in the elven army.  As fighters, they tend towards archers.

### Elf Traits

___
- **Ability Score Increase.** Wisdom +1, Dexterity +2
- **Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, an elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 100 and can live to be 500 years old.
- **Size.** Elves are shorter and lighter than humans, with males and females being approximately the same size.  Your size is Medium.  Consult the chart below for your exact measurements.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
- **Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

___
- **Coloration:** Elves have light brown skin, dark brown or black hair, and brown or green eyes.
- **Languages:** Elvish, Zephyran.  Elves who have travelled will likely know another human language as well.  Very few elves learn Gnomish, but PCs are welcome to.
