Magical items and artifacts in the Age of the Great Dragons.

\page

## Arcane-Infused Gemstones

The magic of the Great Dragons has a tendency to coalesce into gemstones.  The characters will find a few uncut gemstones that inexplicably glow with an internal radiance.

In order to utilize one of these gemstones, you must be attuned to the genstone and it must be on your person.  Unless the description of the item says otherwise, you must be conscious to benefit from any passive effects.

Using *detect magic* on one will identify enchantment magic on them, *identify* will describe its effect, and attuning to it will activate their power.  [Refer to the rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement) for how to attune to an item.

A character can have a number of attuned magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

Arcane-infused gemstones tend to attract [wights](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SyXj8KBem#wights), as both wights and these gemstones are created by the same infusion of arcane power.

## Magical Weapons and Armor

Legends of powerful weapons and wonderous artifacts abound, often named for the mythical hero that created them, owned them, or made them famous. Many of the most famous tales the bards tell revolve around them, from Hew, the wooden greataxe of Magnus the Invincable, to Throatcutter, a dagger made from the spine of a demon -- and possessed by it.

These magical weapons are millenia old.  Each one is a named entity, usually non-sentient, with specific powers and lore.  Mechanically, one might be just *longsword +1* but there will usually be [special features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure#SpecialFeatures) to it.  A named weapon requires attunement.

Just like with arcane magic, Goblinoids are just as likely as humanoids to have access to magical weapons.

### Upgradable Weapons

Unless otherwise indicated, a named weapon grows in power along with its attuned wielder.

| Tier | Character Level | Weapon Bonus
| :-:  | :---: | :---:
| 1    | 1-4   | +0
| 2    | 5-10  | +1
| 3    | 11-16 | +2
| 4    | 17-20 | +3

### Attunement Bonuses

A wielder that is attuned to a named weapon often gains additional abilities.  If an **Attunement Bonus** section exists for a weapon, the abilities listed in it are only available when attuned to the item.

\page

### Named Weapon Examples

#### Hew

This greataxe is simply made and rough-looking.  It gives advantage against creatures made of plants or wood.

#### The Mauler's Fist

The head of this rough-cast mace is fashioned into the shape of a crude fist.  

##### Attunement Bonus

When you roll a critical hit, you can attempt to stun the creature.  The creature must roll a Constitution saving throw; your DC = 8 + your Dexterity bonus + your proficiency bonus.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

#### Splinter

This is a long, slender longsword.

##### Attunement Bonus

Your critical hit range is extended by 1.

#### Throatcutter

*dagger +2*, sentient (NE), made from the spine of a demon.

#### Leviathan Axe

This axe looks like a standard battle axe.  It has the thrown property and a range of 20/60.

##### Attunement Bonus

After throwing the Leviathan Axe, you can recall it into your hand as a bonus action.

Also on a successful hit, you do an additional 1d4 cold damage.  This increases to 2d4 at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th, and 4d4 at 17th.


#### Moonstrike

This elegantly crafted longsword is deceptively light weight. Despite its apparent age it appears completely unblemished and the binding around the grip feels freshly wrapped. The pommel displays the phase of the moon and changes daily.

##### Attunement Bonus

On a hit, you can use your bonus action to heal yourself of hp equal to your proficiency bonus.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per short rest.

#### Ironbark

#### Dawnshard

This [wide-bladed shortsword](http://kultofathena.com/product.asp?item=NM031WS&name=Hobbit+Sword+and+Scabbard) glows when unsheathed, shedding light equal to the *light* spell.

##### Attunement Bonus

You can cause Dawnshard to flare up, interposing the light of the dawn between themself and an attacking enemy.  Once per short rest, you can use you reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.

#### Earthbreaker

2-handed maul, always dirty, with a rough wooden handle.

##### Attunement Bonus

As an action, you may slam Earthbreakers' head onto the ground to create a shockwave before you. All creatures in a 30 foot sphere centered on you must succeed in a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and be stunned until the end of your next turn.  You can do this once per short rest.

#### Goresong

#### Trinity Fang

Three gems of red, blue and green decorate the pommel of this ornate dagger.  By touching one of the three gems and whispering the daggers name the wielder may alter the blade to their liking.

##### Attunement Bonus

As a bonus action, you may activate one of the three gems set into the pommel. Each gem remains activated until it is expended, you activate another gem, or until 1 minute has passed.  Each gem can only be used once per short rest.  If a feature requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

- The red gem adds 1d8 fire damage.
- The blue gem adds 1d4 cold damage on a successful hit, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or have disadvantage on their next attack before the end of you next turn.
- The green gem adds 1d4 poison damage on a successful hit, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain the **poisoned** condition for 1 minute.

#### The Thunderscream Warglaive

##### Attunement Bonus

As an action, you can use the fist as a *mage hand*, with a range of 5 feet.  The hand can be used to do anything *mage hand* can do.

### The Moonweaver

### Darkheart

### Visuals

Pull visuals from http://kultofathena.com/swords.asp, so that each one looks different and cool. Examples:

### Named Armors

#### Armor of heroes


#### Mithril chain shirt

- counts as light armor
- no stealth disadvantage or Dex limit.
- No attunement required.

#### Quick strike bracers (A)

These simple looking bracers may once have been marvelous sights to behold. There is some evidence that they were once painted, but whatever scene was depicted upon their surface has been lost to time.

Despite their weight when picked up, they feel curiously light when secured to the forearms. While wearing these bracers you gain +1 to your Initiative modifier. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wearing light or no armor and using no shield.
