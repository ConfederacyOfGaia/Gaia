Magical items and artifacts in the Age of the Great Dragons.

\page

## Arcane-Infused Gemstones

The magic of the Great Dragons has a tendency to coalesce into gemstones.  The characters will find a few uncut gemstones that inexplicably glow with an internal radiance.

In order to utilize one of these gemstones, you must be attuned to the gemstone and it must be on your person.  Unless the description of the item says otherwise, you must be conscious to benefit from any passive effects.

Using *detect magic* on one will identify enchantment magic on them, *identify* will describe its effect, and attuning to it will activate their power.  [Refer to the rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement) for how to attune to an item.

A character can have a number of attuned magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

Arcane-infused gemstones tend to attract [wights](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SyXj8KBem#wights), as both wights and these gemstones are created by the same infusion of arcane power.

Finally, all effects triggered by the gemstones (except permanent effects, like healing) persist only as long as a character is attuned to it.

## Magical Weapons and Armor

Legends of powerful weapons and wonderous artifacts abound, often named for the mythical hero that created them, owned them, or made them famous. Many of the most famous tales the bards tell revolve around them, from Hew, the wooden greataxe of Magnus the Invincable, to Throatcutter, a dagger made from the spine of a demon -- and possessed by it.

These magical weapons are millenia old.  Each one is a named entity, usually non-sentient, with specific powers and lore.  Mechanically, one might be just *longsword +1* but there will usually be [special features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure#SpecialFeatures) to it.  A named weapon requires attunement.

Just like with arcane magic, Goblinoids are just as likely as humanoids to have access to magical weapons.

### Upgradable Weapons

Unless otherwise indicated, a named weapon grows in power along with its attuned wielder.

| Tier | Character Level | Weapon Bonus
| :-:  | :---: | :---:
| 1    | 1-4   | +0
| 2    | 5-10  | +1
| 3    | 11-16 | +2
| 4    | 17-20 | +3

### Attunement Bonuses

A wielder that is attuned to a named weapon often gains additional abilities.  If an **Attunement Bonus** section exists for a weapon, the abilities listed in it are only available when attuned to the item.
