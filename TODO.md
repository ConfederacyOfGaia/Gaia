# TODO

## World Building

- [ ] Create a map of the entire continent
  - [ ] Concentrate on western, and the areas immediately adjacent; the rest can be left as Terra Incognito.
  - [ ] Goldenwood Mountain should still be a focal point, and the PCs will still start in Wolfwood village, in the foothills of Goldenwood.
- ***The Zeyphyrlands is the name for the west as a whole, and it is further divided into provinces:  Vell, Kylf, Genouj, others.***
  - Impliciations
    - Multiple languages, but all also speak Zephyran, similar to Europe with English as shared language
    - Each province should have a captial city, and 1d4 more cities
    - All provinces share the same calendar, currency, culture, naming conventions
    - Selarius not included; it's a separate, unfindable place
- [ ] Create names for:
  - [ ] The western ocean
  - [ ] The name of the mountain ranges in the center of the continent
    - The names of individual mountains
      - The Slumbering Giant
    - The hills at the western base of the mountains are colloquially called **the Soothills**, but they need an actual name.
    - A large crater in the middle, called the Bowl of Fire, is where the orc civilization lives.  It's about as large as the  western playing area
  - The geopolitical structure of the west
    - [ ] The playing area itself is the confederacy of city-states that I've been defining all along
  - [ ] Define all the provinces in the western half of the continent
    - [ ] Vell
      - [ ] Culture and language
      - [ ] Exports, imports, and relationship to neighbors
      - [ ] Capital city, other cities
      - [ ] Personalities
      - [ ] Landmarks
    - [ ] Kylf
      - [ ] Culture and language
      - [ ] Exports, imports, and relationship to neighbors
      - [ ] Capital city, other cities
      - [ ] Personalities
      - [ ] Landmarks
    - [ ] Genouj
      - [ ] Culture and language
      - [ ] Exports, imports, and relationship to neighbors
      - [ ] Capital city, other cities
      - [ ] Personalities
      - [ ] Landmarks
    - [ ] Selarius (Elven homeland)
      - [ ] Culture and language
      - [ ] Exports, imports, and relationship to neighbors
      - [ ] Capital city, other cities
      - [ ] Personalities
      - [ ] Landmarks
    - [ ] The Orc kingdom in the Bowl of Fire

## History

- [ ] Create an overarching, western-wide history, culminating with the Great Devastation of recent memory that led to the current situation
- [ ] More details of the Great Devastation
- [ ] History of each province

## Races

- [X] Make sure that races and cultures are separate, and individually defined.  When creating a character, the combination of race, country of origin, and background define your ABIs, skills, proficiencies, and starting Feats.
- Any other PC races?
  - Tabaxi
  - Rito
  - Goron

## Backgrounds

- Expand on backgrounds, to bring them more in line with the PHB style

## Cultures

- [ ] Outlanders
  - [ ] Better name
  - [ ] Define their culture
  - [ ] What happened to them during the Great Devastation?  Are they the remains of a human nation that was completely destroyed by the orcs?  Maybe the elders realized that to rebuild would take too much work, and they were too few, and made the radical decision to become wanderers.  This would make them the "lost" civilization.

## Classes

### Druid

- [ ] Certain circles get unarmed fighting abilities based on their animal: Bear, Dragon, others?
- [ ] Define druid circles
  - Each circle gains a few things at 2nd (bonus cantrips, circle spells), then new abilities at 6th, 10th, and 14th.
  - Break Circle of the Land into its component circles, each with a slightly different flavor and abiltiies.  

### Fighter

* Need more combat Feats, especially for fighting styles for specific weapons, as enchanted weapons and metallic armors are going to be rare
* Create a Martial Artist archetype, based on the Monk class below, although no Ki -- use maneuvers instead.
* Soldier archetype?

### Mage

#### Traditions

Removed the need for these; a mage still specialized in a school of magic, but that's it.  Still might try to turn some of these ideas into mage-only Feats, though.

* Warmage: war and combat; evocation school; here's an example which needs a spell list; [Arcanist](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/S1k25Z-Zx) has some cool ideas
* Sage: knowledge; divination school
* Illusionist: illusion school
* Enchanter: enchantment school
* Deathmage: necromancy school
* Elementalists: Firemage, Seamage, Windmage, Earthmage; [Wu Jen](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/EysdjOysl); [this monk tradition](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/S1mWM6-eFe) has some interesting elemental ideas;
* [School of Force](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2qHSBhutOlBJnPSGzZDCGaQnGejpMn3_rDnLsQv2Vwqlh_CMkzg6EnombX3YietusX6D9k2tU6tMcKl/view)
* [School of Arcane Gemstones](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/5sf2i9/new_arcane_tradition_concept_feedback_requested/) - also interesting for the links it contains
* [Chronomancer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6CGYxPaEsSLN083RUV3ZVBnRm8/view)
* [Psychokineticist](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rkvNBed2)

### Ranger

#### Archetypes

* Beastmaster
* Hunter
  * Goblin Hunter (all goblinoids)
  * Dragon Hunter
* Scout
* Protector (chooses a place and defends it)

### Rogue

Need a better definition of their place in the world.

#### Archetypes

* Thief
* Acrobat
* Assassin
* Street Magician


## Feats

- [ ] Need more feats
- Idea:  Move most class features to class-specific Feats, and then let the player choose them when their class level dictates they'd get a new feature.  This would obviate most of the subclass/archetype stuff.
- [ ] Categorize feats by purpose: Combat, Skill, Magic, Flavor

## Magic

- [ ] Create a sheet detailing magic items and what is required to create them, starting with potions and salves.
- [X] Druidic magic is tied to specific regions:  The west, the northern desert, the central mountains, or the eastern plains.  These correspond to regions, and will need to have well-defined borders and overlaps.  A druid's power is attuned to their particular region, so druids have fewer spell points etc as they move farther away from their region.
- [ ] Incentivize gnomes and elves to become mages
- [ ] Arcane magic is still very rare
- [ ] Arcane magic might express itself completely differently in other regions
- [ ] Is there a way to utilize Jedis, Mystics, or Elementalists (Benders)?
- [ ] Non-human spellcasters
- Use http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/gem-mineral-names.php to randomly generate gemstone names
- [ ] Druid cantrips are common to most humans and elves; PCs can be assumed to all have access, and NPCs have a 50% chance.  Gnomes do not get druid cantrips.
- Many types of magic items are going to be less common than other campaigns.  Most importantly, any given non-consumable magic item should only exist if there's a logical, in-game reason for it to exist, rather than just to give it to the PCs.
  - Common: potions; salves
  - Uncommon: weapons; tunics and other apparel; rings and other jewelry;
  - Rare: staves (because mages are rare)
  - Very Rare: metallic armor, shields, gauntlets;
- [ ] Where/how to PCs get magic weapons and armors?
  - Druids can create them also, though they're harder than consumables and require more effort.
- Given that weapons are so rare, should they be unique, and named?
  - 

## Enemies

### Orcs

- [ ] Priests of Gruumsh

## Names

- [ ] Hoofborn Hill (something in Kylf)
- [ ] Darkmoon
