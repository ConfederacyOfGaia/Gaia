      - What happened to them during the Great Devastation?  Are they the remains of a human nation that was completely destroyed by the orcs?  Maybe the elders realized that to rebuild would take too much work, and they were too few, and made the radical decision to become wanderers.  This would make them the "lost" civilization.

- It would be awesome to have an archipelago in the Sinarin ocean to the west.

## History

- [ ] Create an overarching, western-wide history, culminating with the Great Devastation of recent memory that led to the current situation.
  - Before the Great Devastation, there was one huge empire: The Zephyran Empty.  When the orcs ravaged it, it broke into several smaller countries -- Vella, Kylf, Muldr, Genouj, Gaia, the Outlanders -- which have mostly gone their own way.
    - Gaia is the largest in terms of land area, and it has several weak leaders, which is why it was never unified into a single monarchy.  Vella, Kylf, Mudor, and Genouj were all smaller and less distributed, and so were individually unified.
- [ ] More details of the Great Devastation.
- [ ] History of each country.

## NPCs

* Flesh out the demon lord
* Create a few well-known mages of each specialization, across levels
* Create a few high-level druids
* Create a few well-known warriors
* Create a few infamous rogues
* Create some villians are backups

## Races

- [X] Make sure that races and cultures are separate, and individually defined.  When creating a character, the combination of race, country of origin, and background define your ABIs, skills, proficiencies, and starting Feats.
- Any other PC races?
  - I think we need a larger humanoid PC race.  Goliath, or something new?
  - Tabaxi
  - Rito
  - Goron
- Everything will be findable in Mudor.
- Add example names, use http://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html as a seed.

## Backgrounds

- Expand on backgrounds, to bring them more in line with the PHB style

## Classes

The intent of this world is for magic to highlight the main event, and seldom *be* the main event.  Mages use their magic to supplement the skill-based fighting; druids will mostly be wildform fighters and/or tanks, and their magic will be supplemental, prepratory, or post-combat cleanups.

Each class needs to have some unique combat features.  The fighter and ranger classes have several already, but the other classes need fighting styles that come with their specializations.  For example, a Warmage can choose from quarterstaff, scimitar, or double-dagger based styles.  Psychokineticists learn to drop objects on opponents heads, and so on.

- [ ] Break fighting styles out from the Fighter description and into a more general section so that they can be shared between the fighter and ranger classes.

### Druid

- At 2nd  or 3rd level, a druid picks a spirit animal that they emulate, and the abilities they gain as they progress mimic that animal.
  - Get the list of animals from the Lacer supplement.
  - Beasts and animals only!
- When they pick an animal, they start to gain abilities based on their spirit animal, starting with combat abilities:  For example, the ability to temporarily grow claws or fangs for combat.
  - They should also get ABI based on the animal
  - Other features, like darkvision
  - Other traits, like nocturnality or that animal's eating style
- Wildform is limited to their spirit animal, but progresses more quickly than described in the PHB because it's such an important feature
- When an animal is chosen, the DM picks a few spells of every level related to their animal or environment that it inhabits, and these become the druid's Circle spells
- Major features added when they would have normally gained circle features

### Fighter

* Need more combat Feats, especially for fighting styles for specific weapons, as enchanted weapons and metallic armors are going to be rare
* Create a Martial Artist archetype, based on the Monk class below, although no Ki -- use maneuvers instead.
* Soldier archetype?

### Mage

Mages have very little ability without specialization: Arcane sense, basic spellcasting semantics, maybe some metamagic.  The class description should emphasize this:  "mage" is a generic category, not a thing one can *be*.   Other than the basic mechanics, there should be almost no similarity between mages of different specializations.

The flavor sections should include only specific examples: A Warmage, a Sage, and maybe a Psychokineticist (or Jedi, if I can fit it in). 

The general spell list for mages needs to be pretty minimal: the basic diviniations, a few abjurations, and that's pretty much it.  Mages gain their interesting abilities through their specialied spell lists.

Even with specialization, the list of spells available to any given mage will be fairly small and very focused.

#### Changes to Mage

* No spell book required
* Smaller number of known spells, to go along with the smaller list of potential spells
  - Options; final decision needs to depend on the size of the final spell lists
    * 1 per level + Int bonus
    * 1 per level + proficiency bonus + Int bonus
    * Proficiency bonus + Int bonus (assumes bonus spells as class features)
* Fighting style at first level?
* No polymorph or shapeshifting; these are the domain of the druid

#### Specializations

The base mage abilities are pretty minimal, and a mage gains flavor and features through their specialization.

* Jedi - Any way to integrate the caster-based version?
* Warmage: war and combat
* Elementalists: Firemage, Seamage, Windmage, Earthmage)
* Might need an articifer of some kind, that can create permanent, non-consumable magic items.  (Yes, we're back to tinkers again.)  Unlike all the artificer classes on Reddit, this one shouldn't be alchemy-based, though.
* Runemage - Integrate into main mage class

### Ranger

#### Archetypes

* Beastmaster
  - Gains animal companion(s): CR up to 1/2 proficiency bonus, can be multiple smaller animals.  When proficiency bonus increases, the animal can also level up.  Find a companion-building HB class and use as a guideline
* Hunter
  - Favored Enemy stuff
  - Types:
    - Goblin Hunter
    - Kobold Hunter
    - Dragon Hunter
* Scout
* Protector
  - chooses a place and defends it

#### Spells

Spells should be very generic, nature spells

### Rogue

Need a better definition of their place in the world.

#### Archetypes

* Thief
* Acrobat
* Assassin
* Street Magician


## Feats

- [ ] Need more feats
- [ ] Categorize feats by purpose: Combat, Skill, Magic, Flavor

## Magic

- [ ] Create a sheet detailing magic items and what is required to create them, starting with potions and salves.
- [X] Druidic magic is tied to specific regions:  The west, the northern desert, the central mountains, or the eastern plains.  These correspond to regions, and will need to have well-defined borders and overlaps.  A druid's power is attuned to their particular region, so druids have fewer spell points etc as they move farther away from their region.
- [ ] Incentivize gnomes and elves to become mages
- [ ] Arcane magic is still very rare
- [ ] Is there a way to utilize Jedis, Mystics, or Elementalists (Benders)?
- [ ] Non-human spellcasters
- Use http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/gem-mineral-names.php to randomly generate gemstone names
- [ ] Druid cantrips are common to most humans and elves; PCs can be assumed to all have access, and NPCs have a 50% chance.  Gnomes do not get druid cantrips.
- Many types of magic items are going to be less common than other campaigns.  Most importantly, any given non-consumable magic item should only exist if there's a logical, in-game reason for it to exist, rather than just to give it to the PCs.
  - Common: potions; salves
  - Uncommon: weapons; tunics and other apparel; rings and other jewelry;
  - Rare: staves (because mages are rare)
  - Very Rare: metallic armor, shields, gauntlets;
- [ ] Where/how to PCs get magic weapons and armors?
  - Druids can create them also, though they're harder than consumables and require more effort.
- Given that weapons are so rare, should they be unique, and named?


## Enemies

### The Demon Lord

He might be using dragons to do his bidding, who are in turn using kobolds as grunts.

### Orcs

- [ ] Priests of Gruumsh

## Names

- [ ] Hoofborn Hill (something in Kylf)
- [ ] Darkmoon

## Vella


##### Notes

* Barbarians from the north.
  * The barbarian class might makes sense here.  Their rage is reserved for the traditional enemies (see below).
* Use the peoples of Siberian and northern Mongolia as models
* Vellans cities are always built on easily-defended mesas, though there are smaller villages scattered around.
* Also great horsemen, like Kylf, although with a different focus:  Instead of raising horses for sale and profit, Vellan horses are treated like members of the family.  A Vellen horse (need a name for it) is smaller, stronger, and more intelligent than a Kylven horse, and fircely loyal to its master (i.e., unsellable).  They live directly in their owners' homes.  Vellan horses do not have the speed or stamina of Kylven horses, as they are working horses bred for strength and power instead.
* Vella doesn't have druids, it has *shamans*.  Vellans worship a single god that manifests as a giant polar bear, and provides game and holds back the snows.
  * As a result, they consider polar bears to be sacred.
  * Define a cleric class for Vellan priests, with a domain and explicit spell list.
  * These clerics dress in a giant polar bear fur cloak
* Vellans have a traditional enemy: A race of intelligent lizard people (yuan-ti?  troglodites?  lizalfos?), who come from even farther north (the Thundersnow tundra).
* Vellans have their own language, and most don't speak Zephyran.  Though they were technically part of the Zephyran empire, not much changed for them when they were conquered or when the empire fell.
* Vellans trade with the Gaians to their South and/or Kylvens to their east, depending on which part of Vella they live.  Vellan goods are fairly exotic and expensive.
