Maybe the elders realized that to rebuild would take too much work, and they were too few, and made the radical decision to become wanderers.  This would make them the "lost" civilization.
    - [ ] The Orc kingdom in the Bowl of Fire
- It would be awesome to have an archipelago in the Sinarin ocean to the west.
- Creation myths -- maybe there was a time of dragons, similar to our time of dinosaurs

## History

- [ ] Create an overarching, western-wide history, culminating with the Great Devastation of recent memory that led to the current situation.
  - Before the Great Devastation, there was one huge empire: The Zephyran Empty.  When the orcs ravaged it, it broke into several smaller countries -- Vella, Kylf, Muldr, Genouj, Gaia, Eshen -- which have mostly gone their own way.
    - Gaia is the largest in terms of land area, and it has several weak leaders, which is why it was never unified into a single monarchy.  Vella, Kylf, Mudor, and Genouj were all smaller and less distributed, and so were individually unified.
- [ ] More details of the Great Devastation.
- [ ] History of each country.

## NPCs

* Flesh out the demon lord
* Create a few well-known mages of each specialization, across levels
* Create a few high-level druids
* Create a few well-known warriors
* Create a few infamous rogues
* Create some villians are backups
* 7 warlords of Gaia

## Races

- [X] Make sure that races and cultures are separate, and individually defined.  When creating a character, the combination of race, country of origin, and background define your ABIs, skills, proficiencies, and starting Feats.
- Any other PC races?
  - I think we need a larger humanoid PC race.  Goliath, or something new?
  - Tabaxi
  - Rito
  - Goron
- Everything will be findable in Muldr.
- Add example names, use http://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html as a seed.

Maybe do this with gnomes:

>
> Money Changer. I like to make the dwarves establish a primitive banking system for the civilized world. This explains lore-wise why everyone is using the same gold standard in my setting (because the Dwarves used that standard and now they change everyone else's tender into it) as well as gives the party a place to store their excess money instead of carrying it around like mad-men.
> 
> They can also exchange it for gem stones or even investments in tracts of land, etc., if they get enough money in order to either have higher forms of trade or better ensure their hoard.

## Magic

- [ ] Create a sheet detailing magic items and what is required to create them, starting with potions and salves.
- [X] Druidic magic is tied to specific regions:  The west, the northern desert, the central mountains, or the eastern plains.  These correspond to regions, and will need to have well-defined borders and overlaps.  A druid's power is attuned to their particular region, so druids have fewer spell points etc as they move farther away from their region.
- [ ] Incentivize gnomes and elves to become mages
- [ ] Arcane magic is still very rare
- Many types of magic items are going to be less common than other campaigns.  Most importantly, any given non-consumable magic item should only exist if there's a logical, in-game reason for it to exist, rather than just to give it to the PCs.
  - Common: potions; salves

## Enemies

### The Demon Lord

He might be using dragons to do his bidding, who are in turn using kobolds as grunts.

### Orcs

- [ ] Priests of Gruumsh

## Names

- [ ] Hoofborn Hill (something in Kylf)
- [ ] Darkmoon

## Vella

* Barbarians from the north.
  * The barbarian class might makes sense here.  Their rage is reserved for the traditional enemies (see below).
* Use the peoples of Siberian and northern Mongolia as models
* Vellans cities are always built on easily-defended mesas, though there are smaller villages scattered around.
* Also great horsemen, like Kylf, although with a different focus:  Instead of raising horses for sale and profit, Vellan horses are treated like members of the family.  A Vellen horse (need a name for it) is smaller, stronger, and more intelligent than a Kylven horse, and fircely loyal to its master (i.e., unsellable).  They live directly in their owners' homes.  Vellan horses do not have the speed or stamina of Kylven horses, as they are working horses bred for strength and power instead.
* Vella doesn't have druids, it has *shamans*.  Vellans worship a single god that manifests as a giant polar bear, and provides game and holds back the snows.
  * As a result, they consider polar bears to be sacred.
  * Define a cleric class for Vellan priests, with a domain and explicit spell list.
  * These clerics dress in a giant polar bear fur cloak
* Vellans have a traditional enemy: A race of intelligent lizard people (yuan-ti?  troglodites?  lizalfos?), who come from even farther north (the Thundersnow tundra).
* Vellans have their own language, and most don't speak Zephyran.  Though they were technically part of the Zephyran empire, not much changed for them when they were conquered or when the empire fell.
* Vellans trade with the Gaians to their South and/or Kylvens to their east, depending on which part of Vella they live.  Vellan goods are fairly exotic and expensive.

## Genouj

* Similar to Gerudo
* Matriarchal society
* Males are treated as slaves
  * There is a small male breeding class (not playable as PCs) and complex rules around bloodlines to prevent interbreeding.
* Genoujian females are the same physical size and weight as males from other cultures.
* Genouj is famous for its runemages; druids, fighters, rogues are common as well, but very few rangers.
* Create the Runemage class, using the [UA Rune Caster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuMtiayU2p2NTlCdWhmVm5SRjg/view?usp=sharing) as the basis.
