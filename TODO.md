# TODO


- [ ] Integrate nature spirits into the setting.  Call them *roh*, which is indonesian for "spirit, soul, ghost, wraith".
- [ ] Need a complete homebrewery site, backed by github.
- [ ] Create a map of the Zephyrlands.
  - The Sea of Fallen Starts should be in the middle, like the Mediterrean Sea, with the major things around the edges.  Most of the 11 cities of the Zephyran Empire should be on it, and Mount Zephyra should be reachable from it, as well.
- [ ] Make a plan for magical healing, specifically healing potions or something like them.
- Need to deepen the lore around arcane magic

## Geography and Names

- Arching Gulf
- Hoofborn Hill (something in Kylf)
- Darkmoon
- Names for individual mountains in The Sunbloom Mountains:
  - The Slumbering Giant
  - A large valley in the middle, called the Bowl of Fire, is where the orc civilization lives.  It's huge, and has a full civilization in it.
- It would be awesome to have an archipelago in the Sinarin Ocean to the west.

## NPCs

* Flesh out the demon lord
* Create a few high-level druids
* Create a few well-known warriors
* Create a few infamous rogues
* Create some villians are backups
* 11 warlords of Gaia

## Money changers

Maybe do this with one of the races:

> Money Changer. I like to make the dwarves establish a primitive banking system for the civilized world. This explains lore-wise why everyone is using the same gold standard in my setting (because the Dwarves used that standard and now they change everyone else's tender into it) as well as gives the party a place to store their excess money instead of carrying it around like mad-men.

> They can also exchange it for gem stones or even investments in tracts of land, etc., if they get enough money in order to either have higher forms of trade or better ensure their hoard.

## Orcs

- Create a small, complete, advanced civilization in the Bowl of Fire -- orcs in Enda are not dumb brutes.
- Magic use: clerics of Gruumsh, sorcerers, warlocks of Gruumsh

## Vella ideas

* Barbarians from the north.
  * The barbarian class might makes sense here.  Their rage is reserved for the traditional enemies (see below).
* Use the peoples of Siberian and northern Mongolia as models
* Vellans cities are always built on easily-defended mesas, though there are smaller villages scattered around.
* Also great horsemen, like Kylf, although with a different focus:  Instead of raising horses for sale and profit, Vellan horses are treated like members of the family.  A Vellen horse (need a name for it) is smaller, stronger, and more intelligent than a Kylven horse, and fircely loyal to its master (i.e., unsellable).  They live directly in their owners' homes.  Vellan horses do not have the speed or stamina of Kylven horses, as they are working horses bred for strength and power instead.
* Vella doesn't have druids, it has *shamans*.  Vellans worship a single god that manifests as a giant polar bear, and provides game and holds back the snows.
  * As a result, they consider polar bears to be sacred.
  * Define a cleric class for Vellan priests, with a domain and explicit spell list.
  * These clerics dress in a giant polar bear fur cloak
* Vellans have a traditional enemy: A race of intelligent lizard people (yuan-ti?  troglodites?  lizalfos?), who come from even farther north (the Thundersnow tundra).
* Vellans have their own language, and most don't speak Zephyran.  Though they were technically part of the Zephyran empire, not much changed for them when they were conquered or when the empire fell.
* Vellans trade with the Gaians to their South and/or Kylvens to their east, depending on which part of Vella they live.  Vellan goods are fairly exotic and expensive.
