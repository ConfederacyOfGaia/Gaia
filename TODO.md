# TODO

- [ ] Create a map of the entire continent
  - [ ] Concentrate on the Western and Central areas; the rest can be left as Terra Incognito
- [ ] Create names for:
  - [ ] The western and eastern halves of the continent as a whole
    - [X] West = The Zephyrlands
    - [ ] East needs a name, but the people in the west don't know it exists so don't need it yet.
    - [X] Rename west.md, east.md, etc once these are defined
  - [ ] The western ocean
  - [ ] The name of the mountain ranges in the center of the continent
    - The names of individual mountains
      - The Slumbering Giant
    - The hills at the western base of the mountains are colloquially called **the Soothills**, but they need an actual name.
  - The geopolitical structure of the west
    - [ ] The playing area itself is the confederacy of city-states that I've been defining all along
  - [ ] The countries in the western half of the continent
    - Vell
    - Kylf
    - Genouj
    - Selarius (Elven homeland)
- [ ] Define the cultures of the countries in the west
  - [ ] Different countries will have different languages
  - [X] Make sure that races and cultures are separate, and individually defined.  When creating a character, the combination of race, country of origin, and background define your ABIs, skills, proficiencies, and starting Feats.
    - Define typical names in each culture.  http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/nature-names.php is a good start for some of them.
- [ ] Create an overarching, western-wide history, culminating with the Great Devastation of recent memory that led to the current situation
- Changes to magic
  - [X] Druidic magic is tied to specific regions:  The west, the northern desert, the central mountains, or the eastern plains.  These correspond to regions, and will need to have well-defined borders and overlaps.  A druid's power is attuned to their particular region, so druids have fewer spell points etc as they move farther away from their region.
  - [ ] Arcane magic is still very rare
  - [ ] Arcane magic might express itself completely differently in the east
    - [ ] Is there a way to utilize Jedis, Mystics, or Elementalists?
  - Use http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/gem-mineral-names.php to randomly generate gemstone names :)

## Names

- [ ] Hoofborn Hill (something in Kylf)
