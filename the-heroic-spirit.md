### The Heroic Spirit

The Heroic Spirit is the remnant soul of a great warrior of times past. This warrior might have died a long time ago and an evil this champion has fought to end is rising again. It might be a sufficiently powerful creature whose spirit was bound to this plane and it found its way to you. It might be an ancester of yours, come to guide you in your path or trying to retread their own.

#### Expanded Spell List

The Heroic Spirit lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Expanded Spell List
|Warlock level|Spells|
|:-----------:|:-----|
|1st|*heroism*, *longstrider*
|3rd|*enhance ability*, *spiritual weapon*
|5th|*elemental weapon*, *haste*
|7th|*aura of purity*, *death ward*
|9th|*bigby's hand*, *legend lore*
 
#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this Otherworldly Patron at 1st level, you gain proficiency in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

#### Fighting Style

Also at 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon

##### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to get this benefit.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Heroic Guidance

You learn to call upon the tactical wisdom of your patron. Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on all weapon attack rolls and spell attack rolls until the end of the current turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Astonishing Leadership

When you reach 6th level, whenever you cast a spell on one or more allied creatures to give them a beneficial effect, you can choose to grant that effect to yourself as well. You can use this feature even if the spell would only normally affect one creature.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Supernatural Fighting Focus

By the time you reach 10th level, a battlefield is second home to you. You gain a bonus to Concentration checks equal to your Charisma modifier.

Additionally, if you fail a Concentration check, you can use your reaction to repeat that check with advantage. If you fail, you can cast a cantrip as part of that same reaction.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Spirit Armor

At 14th level, you and your patron become so deeply and powerfully intertwined, that you can merge in a heroic display of strength of body and spirit. As an action, you call forth your patron to envelop you as an ethereal suit of armor. You gain the following benefits:

* Once during each of your turns, you automatically succeed on a concentration check.
* Your AC is increased by half of your proficiency bonus.
* Whenever you are hit, or you hit with a weapon attack, you can choose to deal 1d12 force damage to the creature that attacked you or the target of your attack.

These changes last for a minute, are incapacitated or until you dismiss it, no action required.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
