# What Zeb Knows

Zeb has picked up the following bits of information from his half-goliath/half-orc uncle.  Most of this has come in the form of stories or songs.

## Orcs

* The orcs are one of the ***Five Noble Races***.  The other Noble Races are *elves*, *humans*, *dragonbonr*, and *goliaths*.
* The orcs have an advanced civilization in a valley in the Sunbloom Mountains called the ***Bowl of Fire***.
* The orcs place high value history and learning.
* The orcs in the Bowl of Fire practice a very old form of magic based on runes written in the languange of the Giants.  They learn and wield this power by tattooing runes on their bodies.


## The Great Dragons

* This is not the first time the Great Dragons have come from the Sunbloom Mountains and subjugated the land.
* When they come, the magic of the Great Dragons causes devastation and mutation throughout the land.  The orcs first learned to harness this magic thousands of winters ago.
* Every time they come, they stay for 500 winters and then leave for 500 winters.  Why this is so is a mystery.
* One of the effects that the magic of the Great Dragons causes is that some members of the Nobles Races mutate into the ***Ignoble Races***.  The Ignoble Races are *kobolds* (mutated dragonborn), *gnomes* (mutated elves), *dwarves* (mutated goliaths), and *hin* (mutated humans).  The Ignoble Races are said to be degenerate cannibals, bent on destruction and hate, especially toward their Noble counterparts.

## Magic

* Magic entered the world with the Great Dragons, and is stronger when the Great Dragons are in the world.
* Manipulating this magic is done by force of will.
