# Feats

The optional Feat rules are in place for this campaign, and a character may take a Feat instead of an ability score increase.

The following Feats are available, in addition to the Feats described in the PHB.  The Skill-related Feats from the Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills article are also available; any character with a particular Skill may take the corresponding Feat (when they are eligible for a Feat).

## Animal Empathy

Your presence doesn't offend wild animals. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Charisma or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to train and command animals, and on Charisma checks made to deal with animals.
* Normal animals don't attack you unless provoked or commanded.

## Animal Senses

You have keen senses, like those of an animal.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing or smell.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to follow tracks one hour or less old. This advantage is lost if it rains more than lightly, or the target travels across or through water.

## Apothecary

*Prerequisite: Druid, 3rd level or higher; Ranger, 5th level or higher.*

You are skilled at gathering and using herbs to create potions and salves.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Nature checks when creating potions and salves.

## Arcane Ammunition

You have learned to imbue your ranged weapons and ammunition with arcane power. As a bonus action on your turn you can imbue a thrown weapon or piece of ammunition with arcane energy. Pick one of the following cantrips; *shocking grasp, ray of frost, fire bolt, chill touch*. A creature hit by the ammuntion or weapon you imbued before the end of the turn suffers the effects of being hit by the chosen cantrip in addition to the attacks normal effects. Once used, the effect then ends on the weapon or piece of ammunition. The cantrip gains no benefits from being cast by a character of a higher level. Your DM may allow the use of other cantrips for this ability and determines how they might behave.

> ##### Other Cantrips
> A DM might decide to let you choose the *Acid Splash* cantrip. This may behave by having the primary target take 1d6 acid damage as if it had failed it's saving throw. A second target within 5 feet may then need to make a Dexterity save against a DC of 8 + your attack bonus. An alternative to this would be the secondary target taking 1d6 acid damage if the attack roll would also have hit the second target.

##### Notes
I've reasoned this as being equivalent in power to the *dual wielder* feat. Both allow you to use a bonus action to add 1d8 damage while dual wielder grants +1 AC this grants a small rider effect.
</div>

## Athlete

You have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make when using the Athletics skill.
- When you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement. Climbing doesn’t cost you extra movement.
- You may add your proficiency bonus to the distance you are able to cover when performing a  running long jump or half to a running high jump. In addition you need to move only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.

## Botanist

(Merge with Apothecary)

You have mastered the wild and its inhabitants, gaining the following benefits:

- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency with the herbalism kit. If you are already proficient with it, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
- As a bonus action, you can use a herb that would normally require an action to use.
- Herbs in your possession are preserved for twice as long.

## Combat Training

You've trained in a specific style of combat, gaining the following benefits

- Increase your Constitution, Dexterity or Strength score by 1.
- You learn one fighting style of your choice from the list available to the fighter class. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

## Commune with Nature

The character learns how to rejuvenate by relaxing into nature and entering a very deep sleep.  The character requires half as much sleep to be fully rested (4 hours of communing with nature qualifies as a long rest, instead of 8) but is more difficult to awaken.  The character can be treated as sleeping for purposes of combat and surprise, but naturally wakes up in half the time.

## Druid Cantrip

*Prerequisite: Wisdom 11 or greater*

Due to extensive familiarity with nature, you have learned one druidic cantrip.  This Feat is open to any class.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
* Choose any druid cantrip.  You master this cantrip and can cast it at will.
* You can take this Feat multiple times, learning a new cantrip on each occasion.  

### Dual Wielder - PHB
You master fighting with two weapons, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
- You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one handed melee weapons you are wielding aren’t light.
- You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

> ##### House Rule
>  The normal two-weapon fighting rules is now.
>
> "Once per round, when you make an attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can attack with a different, light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand
>
>You do not add your ability modifier to the damage roll of the second attack"

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Notes
This house rule is something I've considered for a while. I've run a lot of numbers on it and in general it comes out to be powerful early but falls behind later on. The monk is most powerful with this because of the native access to a bonus action attack and the fact that later on they increase the damage die available. This said, they are still outdamaged by a great weapon fighter at higer levels even with flurry of blows.

This opens up options for classes like the Eldritch Knight whose *War Magic* feature allows a bonus action attack or Hunter Rangers using *Whirlwind Attack* as both of these will trigger the additional attack.

I advise caution as this has not been thoroughly tested and features that grant bonus action attacks become stronger.
</div>

## Durable

Hardy and resilient, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
- When you are unconscious and become stable you can immediately regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). You must complete a long rest before you can use this ability again.

## Everybody’s Friend

You develop your magnetic personality to ease your way through the world. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Charisma score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. If you’re already proficient in either skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with that skill.

## Knife Master

Your chosen weapon may be short, but few dare to enter your dagger range. You gain the following benefits:

* Your attacks with the dagger cause 2d4 instead of 1d4.
* If you are wielding two daggers, the damage from your second attack adds your ability score bonus.
* Attacking with thrown a dagger at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls.
* When you use the Dodge action, you may use a bonus action to make an attack with a dagger.

## Mage Cantrip

*Prerequisite: Intelligence 11 or greater*

You can learn one mage cantrip.  This Feat is open to any class, but requires studying with a Mage that can already cast the cantrip.

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
* Choose any mage cantrip.  You master this cantrip and can cast it at will.
* You can take this Feat multiple times, learning a new cantrip on each occasion.  

## Martial Artist

You have spent time studying an unarmed martial art.  The specifics of the movements depend on the style, but do not affect game mechanics.  This fighting style provides the following benefits:

* When wearing light or no armor, and not using a shield, you can add your Wisdom bonus to your AC, in addition to your Dexterity bonus.
* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes (player's choice).
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action, if you haven't already taken a bonus action.

* Once per turn, on a successful hit, you may impose one of the following effects on the target (DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier):
  * The target must succeed in a Strength saving throw or drop their weapon.
  * The target must succeed in a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
  * The target must succeed in a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the current round.

* You get an additional attack per turn when welding dual scimitars.
