# Feats

The optional Feat rules are in place for this campaign, and a character may take a Feat instead of an ability score increase.

The following Feats are available, in addition to the Feats described in the PHB.  The Skill-related Feats from the Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills article are also available; any character with a particular Skill may take the corresponding Feat (when they are eligible for a Feat).  The Martial Artist and Master Martial Artist Feats are also available.
