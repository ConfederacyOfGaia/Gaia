# Feats

The optional Feat rules are in place for this campaign, and a character may take a Feat instead of an ability score increase.

The following Feats are available, in addition to the Feats described in the PHB.  The Skill-related Feats from the Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills article are also available; any character with a particular Skill may take the corresponding Feat (when they are eligible for a Feat).  The Martial Artist and Master Martial Artist Feats are also available.

## Animal Empathy

Your presence doesn't offend wild animals. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Charisma or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to train and command animals, and on Charisma checks made to deal with animals.
* Normal animals don't attack you unless provoked or commanded.

## Animal Senses

You have keen senses, like those of an animal.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing or smell.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to follow tracks one hour or less old. This advantage is lost if it rains more than lightly, or the target travels across or through water.

## Apothecary

*Prerequisite: Druid, 3rd level or higher; Ranger, 5th level or higher.*

You are skilled at gathering and using herbs to create potions and salves.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Nature checks when creating potions and salves.

## Commune with Nature

The character learns how to rejuvenate by relaxing into nature and entering a very deep sleep.  The character requires half as much sleep to be fully rested (4 hours of communing with nature qualifies as a long rest, instead of 8) but is more difficult to awaken.  The character can be treated as sleeping for purposes of combat and surprise, but naturally wakes up in half the time.

## Druid Cantrip

*Prerequisite: Wisdom 11 or greater*

Due to extensive familiarity with nature, you have learned one druidic cantrip.  This Feat is open to any class.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
* Choose any druid cantrip.  You master this cantrip and can cast it at will.
* You can take this Feat multiple times, learning a new cantrip on each occasion.  

## Everybody’s Friend

You develop your magnetic personality to ease your way through the world. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Charisma score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. If you’re already proficient in either skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with that skill.

## Knife Master

Your chosen weapon may be short, but few dare to enter your dagger range. You gain the following benefits:

* Your attacks with the dagger cause 2d4 instead of 1d4.
* If you are wielding two daggers, the damage from your second attack adds your ability score bonus.
* Attacking with thrown a dagger at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls.
* When you use the Dodge action, you may use a bonus action to make an attack with a dagger.

## Mage Cantrip

*Prerequisite: Intelligence 11 or greater*

You can learn one mage cantrip.  This Feat is open to any class, but requires studying with a Mage that can already cast the cantrip.

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
* Choose any mage cantrip.  You master this cantrip and can cast it at will.
* You can take this Feat multiple times, learning a new cantrip on each occasion.  

## Martial Artist

You have spent time studying an unarmed martial art.  The specifics of the movements depend on the style, but do not affect game mechanics.  This fighting style provides the following benefits:

* When wearing light or no armor, and not using a shield, you can add your Wisdom bonus to your AC, in addition to your Dexterity bonus.
* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes (player's choice).
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action, if you haven't already taken a bonus action.
* Your base damage for unarmed strikes is 1d4.

## Martial Arts Master

*Prerequisite: Martial Artist Feat*

You are a martial arts master, capable of doing a devastating amount of damage with your unarmed strikes.

* You add your proficiency bonus to your AC, in addition to your Dexterity and Wisdom bonuses.
* You may make a number of unarmed attacks per round equal to your proficiency bonus.  You still get your bonus attack, as defined in the Martial Artist Feat description.
* Your damage die is equal to twice your proficiency bonus.  Thus, at 10th level, your base unarmed damage is 1d8.
* Once per turn, on a successful hit, you may impose one of the following effects on the target (DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier):
  * The target must succeed in a Strength saving throw or drop their weapon.
  * The target must succeed in a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
  * The target must succeed in a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the current round.

## Master War Mage

*Prerequisite: The War Mage Feat*

When you take this Feat, your ability with the *mage armor* and *magic missile* spells improves noticeably:

* **Mage Armor:** The target's AC becomes 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence bonus + the target's Dexterity bonus.
* **Magic Missile:** Each dart does damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus, and the number of darts you can create is equal to 2 + your proficiency bonus, without increasing the cost of the spell.

## Scimitar Master (whirlwind fighting)

*Prerequisite: proficiency with martial weapons*

You have mastered the art of fighting with dual scimitars. This can be taken in addition of the Weapon Specialization Feat with the scimitar, and the effects stack.

* You get an additional attack per turn when welding dual scimitars.
* Your damage bonus applies to your second attack.
* You get a +2 bonus to AC against melee attacks when wielding dual scimitars, due to your increased ability to feint, parry, and deflect incoming weapons.

## Skill Mastery

Your character has honed their skills beyond the level of any other.

* Your character has advantage on any skill check made using a skill in which they are proficient.
* Add 1 point to the ability score of your choice, as long as it relates to a skill in which you are proficient.

## Skill Specialization

You specialize in one of your skills or tools (player's choice):

* Add 1 point to the ability score related to that skill, to a maximum of 20.
* You now have expertise with this skill or tool, allowing you to add double your normal proficiency bonus to any ability check that would benefit from it.
* When you make an ability check that benefits from part or all of your proficiency bonus and you roll a 1 on the d20, you may re-roll the die, though you must use the second result.

## Weapon Specialization

Choose one weapon that you are proficient with. Your mastery of this weapon grant you the following benefits:

* Ability score increase:
  * If your chosen weapon is a ranged weapon, increase Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
  * If your chosen weapon is a finesse weapon, increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1 (player's choice), to a maximum of 20
  * Otherwise, increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20
* When you roll a 1 on an attack roll with this weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. If you already have the ability to reroll a 1 from another source, such as the halfling's lucky trait, you can also reroll when you roll a 2 on an attack roll with this weapon.
* When you roll 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

## War Mage

*Prerequisite: Mage*

When you take this Feat, you learn the *mage armor* and *magic missile* spells, if you don't already know them.  These spells cost half the normal spell point cost.  Additionally, the following modifications are in effect:
