# Session Preparation and Campaign Plot

This document describes the various story elements, plot points, side quests, and so on.  It is part of a 4 document set that includes the [Player's Guide to the Zephyrlands](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/By7LYLm1Rz), the [DM's Guide to the Zephyrlands](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SyXj8KBem), and the [Campaogn log and notes](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SkggVU6Zm).  This document is distinct in that it is not broken into *sessions* (like the campaign log), but into *episodes*.  Each episode will span multiple sessions.

The [campaign log and notes](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SkggVU6Zm) doc will contain session dates (both real-world and in-game), a log of interactions and developments, a list of magic items obtained, and so on.

## TODO

- Rework this guide into episodes
- Each episode should be a top-level H1.
- Each episode will have a number of Key Elements (H2's).

## Episode List

1. Squamusport
1. Nelsa
1. The hin raids

# Squamusport

## Cyrus Coppertongue

Midway through the bard's performance, a man bursts through the door.  He is bleeding from wounds on his head and chest, and panting, as if he'd run a long way.  "Bandits!" He gasps. "Bandits attacked my carriage outside town, and they took my daughter!"

The dragonborn soldiers immediately charge off, presumably to help, and the man falls to the ground, panting.  Folks help him to the bar, and the story comes out:  He was traveling into the city from his farm, about half a day's journey up the North Road, and when he was almost within sight of the city, the bandits jupmed out of the woods, killed his horses, hit him with an axe, and took his daughter.  He didn't see which way they took her before he passed out, but when he came to consciousness there was no sign of them.

His name is ***Cyrus Coppertongue***, and his daughter's name is ***Felicia*** (8 years old).  He is human, his wife (who is back at the Coppertongue farm) is a forest elf, and Felicia is a half elf.

## Bandits!

If the party sets out immediately, and follows the man's directions, they will find the dragonborn losing a fight to 6 bandits.  Regardless of how the party reacts, the dragonborn soldiers will be killed by the bandits.  If the party is hidden, the bandits will not notice them, loot the soldiers' bodies, and then head into the woods.  If the party joins the fight, 2 of the soldiers will fall in the first round, and the bandits will be injured.

The bandit camp will contain several bandits.  If the party killed the bandits on the road, there will be fewer here.  If they did not, they will all be here, and some of those will be injured. (If the party is unharmed from the combat in the road, or did very well, add another 1-2 bandits.)  They will be aggressive and violent immediately.  Their camp contains a chest containing a 342 gilders, along with enough dirty jerkins and poor-quality weapons (mostly wood axes and hand axes) to outfit a band of 8 humans, along with the produce from the Coppertongue wagon.

Felicia Coppertongue is tied up but unharmed in the camp.  

The Coppertongue family wagon lies smashed in the middle of the road, along with its dead horse.  The Coppertongue family are farmers, and the wagon contained produce (which the bandits took).

### Aftermath

When the party returns to the Fiddling Riddle with Felicia, Cyrus is overjoyed.  He has been drinking with the other folks in the bar, and is pretty drunk.  He can't afford to pay the party anything, as everything he had of value with him was taken/destroyed by the bandits, but he will tell them that they are always welcome on the Coppertongue farm.

No one asks what became of the dragonborn soldiers.

## Trouble comes knocking

As they're sitting in the Riddling Fiddle in the morning, 6 dragonborn soldiers come in; 4 soldiers stand by the door, and 2 elite soldiers immediately go over the to bartender.  Have the party notice them -- they're the only ones in the inn, so it's easy.

- The dragonborn ask the bartender something.
- The bartender surreptitiously glances at the party, and then makes "I don't know" motions to the dragonborn, who then leave.
- After they leave, the bartender either calls the party over to the bar or approaches: "Those fine gentlemen were looking for the folks who hunted down the bandits last night. Luckily for you, we all look the same to them. I don't think I need to tell you that the little stunt you pulled last night won't win you any points with the Empire, so I would recommend that you head out as quickly as you can.  Eventually they're going to find someone who's more interested in making a few gilders than in protecting the people who do the right thing. ***I would recommend that you split town as quickly as possible.  There's an Eshen caravan in the eastern field that is supposed to be heading out in the next few days, so if I were you I would start there.***"

## Taking to the road

The Eshen caravan camped outside Squamusport are called ***the Moonies***.  They make their living traveling among the cities on the northwest of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  At each stop along the way, they spend a few weeks trading and teaching at the city or town.  They've been at Squamusport since the 5th of Newsummer (31 days ago), which is a long time for them, and they're itching to leave.

The bard form the Riddling Fiddle is a Moonie, and leaves with the caravan.

***Marcus Hazel*** is the leader of the Moonies.  Marcus is hiring caravan guards, and is getting desperate, as no one is stepping forward. (The last group of guards were slaughtered in an ambush by wights, though he will only admit to that with a successful Persuasion check.)

### Life on the Road with the Moonies

Being a caravan guard is actually pretty easy; because of its size, animals won't attack them, and travelers usually avoid them.  As the guards, the party will be required to stand watch throughout the night, though they can split it among themselves, and there will be a few other guards that were picked up in Squamusport.

### Fourth Day (12th of Peaksummer)

Niamh (the elven female) is still fairly injured, and will have difficulty keeping up.  Arris (the elven male) will stay with her, so they will both be lagging far behind.  They don't have horses.  This will provide a chance for the party to offer Quilyn's wagon for her to sleep in, where she will be able to get in a short rest.

A little before mid-day, in the distance to the north, the party will see signs of a settlement: a road turning north, and smoke rising to the sky.  This is the city of Orlane, and anyone on the caravan can identify it, including Quilyn and the other guards.

There is a large road sign here, with several signs on it

#### Signs

This sign points north:

1. Orlane

These signs points east:

1. Central Gaia
1. Whisperwood
1. Silver Falls
1. Sterling City
1. Mount Zephyra
1. Nelsa
1. Mazurek

These signs points west:

1. Squamusport
1. Scarletgard
1. Fourwinds

Later in the afternoon on the fourth day, the caravan will be overtaken and passed by a merchant in an overfull cart, moving very quickly.  If stopped, he will say that he is leaving his home and heading to Nelsa to start over after his family was killed in Orlane.  He will hint that strange things are going on, but won't say more, and will leave.

The caravan puts more miles behind it than usual on this day.

### Fourth Night

On the fourth night of the trip, a group of travelers will approach them during first shift.  Introduce this like an encounter, but when they come into the light, they turn out to be a group of travelers that ran out of supplies and don't want to starve.  The group will spend the night with the caravan, and then head in the opposite direction in the morning.

Buckley will take first watch, and will engage with whoever he is paired with.

"Are we going to take about what the fuck happened last night?  Have you ever seen anything like that before, those walking corpses?"

Niamh does not take a watch on this night; she is still recuperating.  If they make a thing about it, Arris will take 2 watches.

### Fifth Day (13th of Peaksummer)

More grasslands.

Not long after mid-day, Romero notices smoke rising over a ridge to the south, but, unlike the previous day, there's no road heading in that direction, and the guards and Quilyn can confirm there are no known settlements in that direction.  If they decide to investigate, it's a Bandit Camp.

In the afternoon, the caravan needs to make an unanticipated stop, as one of the wagon's horses injures itself on the road.  Marcus will decide to make camp earlier than usual, since the caravan made excellent time the day before.

### Fifth Night

The party reaches the crossroads: The White Forest Road butts up against the Great Zephyran road.

The caravan will set up for the night by the crossroad.

The party just defeated 9 wights and accumulated 3 additional gemstones (1 green, 1 red, 1 blue), but the green gemstone they had dissolved.

After defeating the wights, you headed back to the caravan.  Marcus decides that the caravan is too weak to keep going, so the caravan stays where it is.  A few nervous Eshen stand guard with the party, but the night is uneventful and passes quietly.

If the party takes the gemstones out at all, have Romero make a comment on them, as a way to give the party info about attuning to them.

### Sixth Day (14th of Peaksummer)

There is a large road sign, with several signs on it.

#### North

1. Central Gaia
1. Whisperwood
1. Silver Falls
1. Sterling City
1. Mount Zephyra

#### South

1. Nelsa
1. Mazurek

#### West

1. Orlane
1. Squamusport
1. Scarletgard
1. Fourwinds

Marcus rouses the caravan early, and plans to get to Nelsa as quickly as possible.

This day is uneventful, and the party will arrive at Nelsa close to dusk.  The caravan sets up camp right outside the town, and Marcus will aproach the party, thank them for their service, and let them know that the caravan plans to stay in Nelsa until the next High Confluence, which marks the beginning of the harvest season (Autumn). (This is about 3.5 weeks.)

\page

# Nelsa

Nelsa is a sleepy town, full of hard workers: mostly farmers and brewers. The main town is built on a small island in the center of the river that follows the Great Zephyran Road.  A single stone bridge, barely wide enough for two carts, is all that connects the island to the mainland.

There are no walls around the town, and buildings go almost right up to the edge of the hill on which the town is built.  The buildings are goliath-sized, single story, and squat.  The only exception is the shrine to Bahamut and Tiamat, which is on the northernmost side of the hill.

## Mood in the town

The party will immediately notice an increased dragonborn presence, constantly patrolling the town's island and looking out over the edges to the east.  The population is normally friendly and cheerful, but the current mood is dark, because of the attacks.

The party has arrived in Nelsa on the night before Midsummer Day, which is a Low Confluence.  The town is planning for their Midsummer festival and feast, though their spirits are somewhat damped by the attacks.  The central area of the town is decorated in the traditional fashion.

## Feast of Midsummer

The Feast of Misdummer is normally a grand party, though the festivities are damped this year by the recent attacks.

Traditionally, Midsummer is when marriages are performed and when babies are named.  (Because this is when marriages are performed, babies tend to be born in the spring, and thus are ~3 months old when they're named.)

During the Feast of Midsummer:

- There will be 3 weddings: one betweeen two humans, one between 2 goliaths, and one between a goliath male and human female.
- There will be 2 baby namings: both human females, 3 months old.




\page

# The hin raids

The farms on the edges of Nelsa have been targetted by the hin, which started a few weeks ago.  The hin come in the cover of darkness, every few days; they steal human children from the outlying farms.  There have been 6 human deaths and many injuries, and several dozen dragonborn soldiers have been killed in action as well.  The dragonborn soldiers have widened their patrols to include some of the closer farms, but they simply don't have the numbers to protect every farm.

Several nights before the party arrives, there was a particularly bad attack; several soldiers were killed, and the injured ones are being treated in the shrine.

The night the party arrives will be uneventful, as will the next several nights.  On the designated night, the hin will attack one of the farms.

## Chasing the hin

If the party tries to go the fighting, it will be over they will arrive.  They will be able to find tracks and follow the hin, if they are so inclined.  Despite their small size, the hin move quickly (more quickly than the party) so they will have the lead.

## The caves of the hin

The hin are occupying a group of about a dozen caves set into a hill, abut 3 hours from Nelsa by foot.  The caves are arranged around a central area, *Caves of Chaos* style, and the central area has lots of natural cover (mostly brush and small trees).  This is enough for an enterprising PC or hin to Hide behind during combat, and can afford partial cover even for those not hidden.  There is a large firepit in the approximate center of the valley that the hin gather around.

The map for this area can be drawn roughly. Many of the caves are hidden behind brush or rocks, so they will not all be immediately visible (though they can be found without a roll, for the most part).

Except for the two largest caves (see below), each individual cave is 1-3 natural rooms, and each room houses 1d2 hin.  The hin are a mix of male and female adults, but there are no young.

Any given cave will have a few recently-killed bodies of both small mammals and small humanoids (DC 12 Nature or Medicine check to tell that they're human).  The bodies are gnawed and have most of the fleshy bits picked clean, and are very smelly.

If the party arrives during the day, there will be several hin in the center of the hillside, in the open.  They will be standing around a large central cooking fire, like bokoblins, and will not be expecting trouble.

If the party arrives during the night, the hin will be mostly sleeping in the caves, though there will be a few around the firepit in the central area.

### The large caves

There are two larger caves in the complex.

The first is on the ground level and is being used as a corral.  It contains the surviving human children that the hin have taken; they are bound and gagged and very unwell.  The hin are planning to eat them, and probably soon.  This corral can also contain any other prisoners that are required for plot reasons.

The second cave is the entrance to a large complex that will be the beginnings of a multi-room dungeon/cave complex.  This cave is higher up on the hill.

### The cave complex

***Terrain.*** The caves are natural, sloping, and uneven.  In some places they are very tall and wide, and in others they are narrow, to the point where the party will need to crawl to navigate them.

The uneven tunnels are difficult terrain, so all movement speeds are halved, and they are completely dark.

Introduce at least one sliding-floor trap, where the lead members will need to make a Dexterity save or slide down sloping ramp,

There will be large cavern, deep underground, with a small underground lake in it and a waterfall that falls into it.  The party will hear splashing sounds leading up to it.  The room is filled with an obscuring mist that limits visibility: bright light becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness, and darkness stays darkness.  This will make it much harder to see and fight.

When drawing the large cavern, only draw what the party can see, not the whole room right away!

***Light and Vision.*** Be extra careful about torch light and visibility in the caves, especially in the large cavern.  The need to carry torches is going to make it impossible to use shields and difficult to use two-handed weapons like mauls or ranged weapons.

- Attacking a target you cannot see is done at disadvantage.
- Attacking a target in dim light is normal.
- Dim light imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Creatures.*** The hin have not traveled far into this tunnel, so there will need to be other hazards.


- [Giant rats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-rat)
- [Bats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bat)
- [Stirges](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/stirge)
- [Giant fire beetle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-fire-beetle)

- [Grick](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/grick)
- [Grick alpha](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/grick-alpha)


#### Entrance cavern

The entrace to the tunnel leads to a good-sized natural cavern, and contains the recently-killed bodies of several hin. They have been picked clean of items, and gnawed at by small teeth (giant rats).  It also contains 2 [cave fishers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cave-fisher), which will attempt to ambush the party.


***Treasure.*** At at least two points, the party will find corpses of adventurers from the distant past.  These will have at least one legendary magical weapon and wondrous item for the party to find.

One of these, near the entrance but farther in than the first room, will be several recently-killed dragonborn soldiers.  The wounds on these don't look like wounds the hin could inflict (they were killed by the *final creature*, below).

***Final Creature.*** In the largest cave, there will need to be a boss fight of some kind -- the main creature that lives in the caverns.  It needs to be something from the [Underdark monster list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/appendix-b-monster-lists#MonstersbyEnvironment) and should be hard to fight and kill.  Remember that they don't have much magic, so something like a troll (needs to be killed by fire or acid) will be very, very difficult for them.  Also, it should be something monstrous, not something even slightly intelligent.

The creature will have the bodies of former adventuring parties stacked around its room, so there will be lots of loot, including platinum, gold, and silver, just laying around.

# Marcus and the Brotherhood of Thunder

The last time the Moonies were in Nelsa, The *Brotherhood of Thunder* asked Marcus to carry contraband to Squamusport, but he refused.  They decided to teach him a lesson and kidnap him.  However, they did not do a great job; his capture was too clean, so the Moonies did not notice that he had been taken, just that he was missing.

On the 19th, the Brotherhood will send



A DC 20 investigation check would reveal that the lock to his wagon had been tampered with: opened and then closed.  Inside the wagon are signs of struggle, but outside everything looks normal.
