# Magic

The magic of nature pervades the land, and is easily accessible by many people.  Some people develop an affinity with the natural world and learn to harness its power; these people are called *[druids](druids.md)*.  Others learn to shape the arcane forces that are woven through the fabric of the world, and become *[mages](mages.md)*.  The forces each uses are the same, but their approaches differ radically.

The rules around magic in this setting differ substantially from most other D&D worlds, in several important ways:

* Magic potential is based on spell points, not spell slots.
* Spell components are not needed, except where the spell affects or consumes a specific material component as part of its effect.
* Each class has their own spell list, but the core lists are miniaml.  Casters gain additional spells through their specializations, which are very specific, and, for druids, are developed by the player and DM working in concert, based on choices the druid makes early in their career.
* Rune magic is still under development, but the basic idea is that the runecaster imbues the effect into a *rune* that is inscribed on an item (usually a stone).  The run can then be triggered at any time, and the effect is centered on the item on which the rune is enscribed.

## Spellcasters

### Natural Magic

Users of natural magic, which includes [druid](druid.md), [rangers](ranger.md), and anyone with the Druid Cantrip Feat, learn their magic through immersion in nature.  Druids and rangers have full access to the spell lists for their class, level, and circle or conclave, and, after a long rest, spend time meditating and communing with nature.  It is during this time that they choose their prepared spells.

### Arcane Magic

Users of arcane magic are rare in the Zephyrlands, but that is due to an accident of history, not something inherent in the nature of magic or this plane.  A player who wants to play an [arcane spellcaster](mage.md) needs to come up with an explanation of where and how the character learns their ability, and find a way to get new spells, since the normal way of learning them from peers or a master probbaly won't be an option.

Because it is so difficult to find spells, the mage's general spell list is fairly limited.  When a mage chooses a specialization at level 3, their spell lists gets larger, but more focused.

### Psionics

There's still a chance this will be a thing....

## Non-Spellcasters

Most gaians have a close connection to the earth and to nature, and, as a result, many of them develop the ability to cast a druid cantrip or two.  A PC with a Wisdom bonus is eligible for the Druid Cantrip Feat, which gives them a single cantrip.  This Feat can be taken a number of times equal to 0 + Wisdom bonus.

## Using Magic

Magic in Gaia is based on a points system, as outlined in chapter 9 of the DMG and summarized below.

### Spell Points By Level

Level | Spells Points | Maximum Spell Level
:---: | :---: | :---:
1st | 4 | 1st
2nd | 6 | 1st
3rd | 14 | 2nd 
4th | 17 | 2nd 
5th | 27 | 3rd 
6th | 32 | 3rd 
7th | 38 | 4th 
8th | 44 | 4th 
9th | 57 | 5th 
10th | 64 | 5th 
11th | 73 | 6th 
12th | 73 | 6th 
13th | 83 | 7th 
14th | 83 | 7th 
15th | 94 | 8th 
16th | 94 | 8th 
17th | 107 | 9th 
18th | 114 | 9th    
19th | 123 | 9th 
20th | 133 | 9th   

The above table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. At each level, add a number of bonus points equal to your Intelligence (mages) or Wisdom (druids and rangers) bonus as well. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell points determined by the level of the spell you are casting (see the Spell Point Cost table, below). If you reduce your spell point total to 0, you gain a level of exhaustion. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest, and half of your expended spell points after a short rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to cast a maximum of one spell of each level above 5th until you take a long rest. If you attempt to cast another spell of the same level before taking a long rest, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + the level at which you are casting the spell). If you fail the saving throw, you take 1d6 points of necrotic damage for each level of the spell. If you succeed the saving throw, you take half damage. If you survive the damage, the spell is successful.

If you cast a spell with insufficient spell points to pay for its cost, you subtract your total remaining spell points from the spell's cost and suffer 1d6 necrotic damage for every unpaid spell point remaining. For example, if you have four spell points and attempt to cast a 3rd level spell, which costs five spell points, you would take 1d6 necrotic damage.  If you survive this damage, the spell succeeds. 

### Spell Point Cost

Spell Level | Point Cost
:---: | :---:
1st | 2
2nd | 3
3rd | 5
4th | 6
5th | 7
6th | 9
7th | 10
8th | 11
9th | 13

In order to cast a spell as a higher level, the caster pays the increased point cost and gets the increased effect, so *magic missile* cast as a 3rd-level spell costs 6 points instead of 2.

## Magic Items

Unlike other campaign settings, where magic weapons, armor, and miscellaneous items are common, such items are rare here.  Much more common are consumable magic items like potions and salves, which can be [easily created](#creating-magic-items) by druids (including PC druids) from naturally occurring ingredients and components.

Most villages have merchants that will carry magic trinkets and potions, although there are a lot of charlatains out there.  A druid or mage of 2nd level or higher will be able to detect if an item is legitimately enchanted or not.

### Magic Items Available from Merchants

* Potion or salve of healing ($HD = the character's HD)
  * Pale red: cures 1d$HD+1, costs 10 gilders
  * Red: cures 2d$HD+2, costs 20 gilders
  * Dark red: cures 3d$HD+3, costs 30 gilders
  * Blood red: cures 4d$HD+4, costs 40 gilders
* Jewelry of protection (examples)
  * Ring with diamond inlay (+1 to AC): 100 gilders
  * Diamond earrings (+1 to AC each): 100 gilders
  * Tourmaline earrings (resistance to cold and cold damage): 100 gilders
  * Lucky talisman (advantage on every save and skill check): 1000 gilders
* Cloak of hiding: this cloak appears to be the color of shadows, and adds an advantage to all attempts the wearer makes to hide.  Can be purchased for 100 gilders.
* Small devices that duplicate the effect of many cantrips are also available.  The cost for these items will generally be low to medium, from 10-50 gilders.  Examples:
  * A lighter: a small device that generates a 2" flame on demand.  This can't be used in combat, but it can be used to start fires.
  * A gemstone enchanted to emit light in a 30 foot radius when uncovered
  * A rope that can tie and untie itself.
  * A bag of holding (in various sizes)
* Enchanted arrows, similar to Breath of the Wild: fire, ice, lightning, acid. In addition to the damage for the arrow itself, these do 1d8 additional damage, and can have additional effects depending on the type.  Price: 10 gilders each.
* Enchanted sling stones (or throwing stones): fire, ice, lightning, acid.  In addition to the damage for the sling stone itself, these do 1d8 additional damage and can have additional effects depending on type type.  If thrown, they do only their magical damage. If these miss their target, there is a chance that they will not burst and can be retrieved for future user, at the DM's option. Price: 8 gilders each.

### Commissioning Magic Items

The PCs can commission specific magic items from high level druids, once they find one willing to do so.  In the larger cities, there are often several druids who earn a living by making such items, though they will be difficult to find and expensive to hire.

## Creating Magic Items

### Consumables

A character with the Botanist Feat can create consumable magic items (potions and salves) from natural components.  Most of these do not require that the druid cast spells as part of the process.  Druids gain this Feat at 3rd level, and rangers gain it at 5th level.  Either class may take the Botanist II Feat at a higher level, which improves the skill.  Characters other than druids or rangers can take the Botanist Feat (though not the Botanist II Feat) and create potions and salves.

#### Mechanics of Creation

Creating a potion or salve requires a fire, a pot, the components, and the right amount of time.  The maker must make a Wisdom check every hour for success, applying their proficiency bonus.  A failure means that hour needs to be redone and rerolled, and 2 failures in a row means the batch is ruined.  The Botanist II Feat gives advantage on these checks and halves both the cooking time and the number of checks that need to be made (although never below 1).

Item rarity | Cooking time | DC
--- | ---- | ----
Common | 1 hours | 10
Uncommon | 2 hours | 14
Rare | 3 hours | 18
Very Rare | 4 hours | 22

A druid can have several creations happening simultaneously, up to their proficiency bonus, though this might require multiple firepits.  The amount of potion or salve that can be created at any given time depends on the size of the cooking receptacle and amount of components, so it's in the druid's favor to create large batches since the check is per batch.

#### Finding ingredients and components

The PCs can search the countryside for components and ingredients. The DM decides whether the ingredients can be found in a given location, and, if so, consults the table below. The PCs make either a Medicine or Nature check (player's choice) to find the items.  The player makes a single check per time period as indicated in the Active search time column, so depending on the amount of time spent and the amount of the component or ingredient needed, the PC could spend all day looking for components.  The PCs cannot travel during the time spent searching.  If the particular item is Common or Uncommon, the DM might rule that PCs can make a passive perception check periodically to notice the item while traveling.

Component rarity | Active search time | Passive search time | DC
--- | ---- | ---- | ----
Common | 15 minutes | 1 hour | 5
Uncommon | 1 hour | 3 hours | 10
Rare | 3 hours | - | 15
Very Rare | 12 hours | - | 20

### Non-Consumable Magic Items

Other types of magic items are creatable by druids, but are more complex.  These usually require that the druid cast a spell that duplicates the desired effect, and also requires ingredients and components: gems of specific types.  Luckily, most goblinoid races use gemstones as currency and hoard them whenever possible, so access to gems won't be difficult.

#### Mechanics of Creation

The item to be enchanted must be present; it is almost always created especially for the purpose of enchanting it, though there are exceptions (legendary weapons, a monk's staff, etc).  The gemstones are consumed by the process, and the DM determines which spells are required.  For example, *shillelagh* cast at 3rd level along with 9 diamonds to make a +3 weapon.

Another option is to create a salve that duplicates the effect and then smear it onto the weapon or armor, and then set the enchantment.  Creating the salve is a separate process and requires its check, and then setting the enchantment requires a spell (need to create a spell for it).  This is how magic arrows are created; a typically-sized salve will be enough to enchant ~10 arrows.

#### Gemstones

When determining which gems to include in a goblinoid hoard, roll 1d11 for each gem.

d12 | Effect | Gem
----| ---- | ----
1 | Acid | Pearl
2 | Cold | Tourmaline
3 | Fire | Garnet
4 | Force | Sapphire
5 | Lightning | Citrine
6 | Necrotic | Jet
7 | Poison | Amythest
8 | Psychic | Jade
9 | Radiant | Topaz 
10 | Thunder | Spinel
11 | Power | Diamond
12 | TDB | Emerald
