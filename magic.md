# Magic

Druids can create consumable magic items easily, but non-consumables are harder to make and therefore much more rare.  Arrows, blowgun darts, daggers, and so on can be dipped in a salve before being fired.

* I need to create a sheet detailing magic items and what is required to create them, starting with potions and salves.
* Druid cantrips are common to most humans and elves; PCs can be assumed to all have access, and NPCs have a 50% chance.  Gnomes do not get druid cantrips.
* Mages are rare, and arcane magic is rare.  More common among non-humans, though: gnomes favor illusions, elves favor enchantments, though these are not requirements.
* Many types of magic items are going to be less common than other campaigns.  Most importantly, any given non-consumable magic item should only exist if there's a logical, in-game reason for it to exist, rather than just to give it to the PCs.
  * Common: potions; salves
  * Uncommon: weapons; tunics and other apparel; rings and other jewelry;
  * Rare: staves (because mages are rare)
  * Very Rare: metallic armor, shields, gauntlets;

## Creating Magic Items

### Consumables

Starting at 3rd level, druids can create consumable magic items: Potions and salves.  Most of these do not require that the druid cast spells as part of the process.

#### Finding ingredients and components

The PCs can search the countryside for components and ingredients. The DM decides whether the ingredients can be found in a given location, and, if so, sets the DC for the search, based on the commonality of the ingredient. The PCs make either a Medicine or Nature check (player's choice) to find the items.  A single check represents 30m of searching, so depending on the amount of time spent and the amount of the component or ingredient needed, the PC could spend all day looking for components.  The PCs cannot travel during the time spent searching.  If the particular item is plentiful, the DM might rule that PCs can make a passive perception check every 30m to notice some items while traveling.

#### Mechanics of Creation

Creating a potion or salve requires a fire, a pot, the components, and the right amount of time.  The druid must make a Wisdom check every hour for success, applying their proficiency bonus as well.  Any failure means that hour needs to be redone and rerolled, and 2 failures in a row means the batch is ruined.  The Apothecary Feat gives advantage on this check.

Rarity | Cooking time | DC
--- | ---- | ----
Common | 1 hours | 11
Uncommon | 2 hours | 14
Rare | 3 hours | 17 
Very Rare | 4 hours | 21

A given druid can have several creations happening simultaneously, up to their proficiency bonus, though this might require multiple firepits.

### Non-Consumable Magic Items

Other types of magic items are creatable by druids, but are more complex.  These usually require that the druid cast a spell that duplicates the desired effect, and also requires ingredients and components:  gemstones of specific types.

#### Mechanics of Creation

The item to be enchanted must be present; it is almost always created especially for the purpose of enchanting it, though there are exceptions (legendary weapons, a monk's staff, etc).  The gemstones are consumed by the process, and the DM determines which spells are required.  For example, *shillelagh* cast at 3rd level along with 9 diamonds to make a +3 weapon.

Another option is to create a salve that duplicates the effect and then smear it onto the weapon or armor, and then set the enchantment.  Creating the salve is a separate process and requires its check, and then setting the enchantment requires a spell (need to create a spell for it).  This is how magic arrows are created; a typically-sized salve will be enough to enchant ~10 arrows.
