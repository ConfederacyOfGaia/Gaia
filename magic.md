# Magic

The magic of nature pervades the land, and is easily accessible by many people.  Some people develop an affinity with the natural world and learn to harness its power; these people are called *[druids](druids.md)*.  Others learn to shape the arcane forces that are woven through the fabric of the world through sheer force of will, and become *[sorcerers](sorcerers.md)*.  Finally, a rare few form pacts with the spirits of the land, and become *[warlocks](warlocks.md)*.

* Spell components are not needed, except where the spell affects or consumes a specific material component as part of its effect.

## Spellcasters

### Natural Magic

Users of natural magic, which includes [druid](druid.md) and [rangers](ranger.md), learn their magic through immersion in nature.  Druids and rangers have full access to the spell lists for their class, level, and circle or conclave, and, after a long rest, spend time meditating and communing with nature.  It is during this time that they choose their prepared spells.

### Arcane Magic

Users of arcane magic are rare in the Zephyrlands, but that is due to an accident of history, not something inherent in the nature of magic or this plane.  A player who wants to play an [arcane spellcaster](sorcerer.md) needs to come up with an explanation of where and how the character learns their ability.

### Pact Magic

### Psionics

Psions are extremely rare in Gaia, but they do exist.  A psion uses the bard chassis, reflavored as psionics, although they only have access to the College of Lore as a subclass. (And possibly whispers?)


## Magic Items

Unlike other campaign settings, where magic weapons, armor, and miscellaneous items are common, such items are rare here.  Much more common are consumable magic items like potions and salves, which can be [easily created](#creating-magic-items) by druids (including PC druids) from naturally occurring ingredients and components.

Most villages have merchants that will carry magic trinkets and potions, although there are a lot of charlatains out there.  A druid or mage of 2nd level or higher will be able to detect if an item is legitimately enchanted or not.

### Magic Items Available from Merchants

* Enchanted sling stones (or throwing stones): fire, ice, lightning, acid.  In addition to the damage for the sling stone itself, these do 1d8 additional damage and can have additional effects depending on type type.  If thrown, they do only their magical damage. If these miss their target, there is a chance that they will not burst and can be retrieved for future user, at the DM's option. Price: 8 gilders each.

### Commissioning Magic Items

The PCs can commission specific magic items from high level druids, once they find one willing to do so.  In the larger cities, there are often several druids who earn a living by making such items, though they will be difficult to find and expensive to hire.

## Creating Magic Items

### Consumables

A character with the Botanist Feat can create consumable magic items (potions and salves) from natural components.  Most of these do not require that the druid cast spells as part of the process.  Druids gain this Feat at 3rd level, and rangers gain it at 5th level.  Either class may take the Botanist II Feat at a higher level, which improves the skill.  Characters other than druids or rangers can take the Botanist Feat (though not the Botanist II Feat) and create potions and salves.

#### Mechanics of Creation

Creating a potion or salve requires a fire, a pot, the components, and the right amount of time.  The maker must make a Wisdom check every hour for success, applying their proficiency bonus.  A failure means that hour needs to be redone and rerolled, and 2 failures in a row means the batch is ruined.  The Botanist II Feat gives advantage on these checks and halves both the cooking time and the number of checks that need to be made (although never below 1).

Item rarity | Cooking time | DC
--- | ---- | ----
Common | 1 hours | 10
Uncommon | 2 hours | 14
Rare | 3 hours | 18
Very Rare | 4 hours | 22

A druid can have several creations happening simultaneously, up to their proficiency bonus, though this might require multiple firepits.  The amount of potion or salve that can be created at any given time depends on the size of the cooking receptacle and amount of components, so it's in the druid's favor to create large batches since the check is per batch.

#### Finding ingredients and components

The PCs can search the countryside for components and ingredients. The DM decides whether the ingredients can be found in a given location, and, if so, consults the table below. The PCs make either a Medicine or Nature check (player's choice) to find the items.  The player makes a single check per time period as indicated in the Active search time column, so depending on the amount of time spent and the amount of the component or ingredient needed, the PC could spend all day looking for components.  The PCs cannot travel during the time spent searching.  If the particular item is Common or Uncommon, the DM might rule that PCs can make a passive perception check periodically to notice the item while traveling.

Component rarity | Active search time | Passive search time | DC
--- | ---- | ---- | ----
Common | 15 minutes | 1 hour | 5
Uncommon | 1 hour | 3 hours | 10
Rare | 3 hours | - | 15
Very Rare | 12 hours | - | 20

### Non-Consumable Magic Items

Other types of magic items are creatable by druids, but are more complex.  These usually require that the druid cast a spell that duplicates the desired effect, and also requires ingredients and components: gems of specific types.  Luckily, most goblinoid races use gemstones as currency and hoard them whenever possible, so access to gems won't be difficult.

#### Mechanics of Creation

The item to be enchanted must be present; it is almost always created especially for the purpose of enchanting it, though there are exceptions (legendary weapons, a monk's staff, etc).  The gemstones are consumed by the process, and the DM determines which spells are required.  For example, *shillelagh* cast at 3rd level along with 9 diamonds to make a +3 weapon.

Another option is to create a salve that duplicates the effect and then smear it onto the weapon or armor, and then set the enchantment.  Creating the salve is a separate process and requires its check, and then setting the enchantment requires a spell (need to create a spell for it).  This is how magic arrows are created; a typically-sized salve will be enough to enchant ~10 arrows.

#### Gemstones

When determining which gems to include in a goblinoid hoard, roll 1d11 for each gem.

d12 | Effect | Gem
----| ---- | ----
1 | Acid | Pearl
2 | Cold | Tourmaline
3 | Fire | Garnet
4 | Force | Sapphire
5 | Lightning | Citrine
6 | Necrotic | Jet
7 | Poison | Amythest
8 | Psychic | Jade
9 | Radiant | Topaz 
10 | Thunder | Spinel
11 | Power | Diamond
12 | TDB | Emerald
